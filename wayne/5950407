46 ContributorsMy Window Lyrics
(Got it on Smash)
I'm smokin' on the best right now
Believe that
I can vouch for that, I can bet money on that

That whip cost money, I ain't lyin'
My mama said I did it, I'm up, stop playin' with me, yeah
He get caught playin' games, receive that fine, yeah
Shawty got a thing for them tunes, I been playin' her keys

In jail, but daddy be prayin' for me
Goin' hard like I done did thirty years
Trials in life went through, I beat
Made it out, still tryna get thirty kills
Alright, but life was hard
Grew up, got smart, but still gon' murder still
I be countin' money 'til they throw the appeal
I be where it's grimy, steady keepin' it real

Eyes out my window
Tryna make sure that these niggas don't get one in, though
I'm inside this bitch with extendos
No love, no loss, so
Can't depend on niggas
Wrist out left my hand cold
What you think I'm tryna win for?
You might also like
And it's so much more
My mama, she know that I got it, I gotta achieve, yeah
I'm collectin' them dollars, invest in who slangin' them choppers
They a part of this lead, I'm sayin'
Them hundreds won't matter forever
They play, we gon' murder the man, all ten
Baton Rouge, New Orleans where a young nigga headed with birds in a van
I can give you a clue, what I cannot do is show you my hand
You gon' make me hurt you, no, I won't choose, stop playin'
Make me cool when I come through, you know you can (Rap shit)
I'm gon' get you so high, you cannot land

Eyes out my window
Tryna make sure that these niggas don't get one in, though
I'm inside this bitch with extendos
No love, no loss, so
Can't depend on niggas
Wrist out left my hand cold
What you think I'm tryna win for?

That whip cost money, I ain't lyin'
My mama said I did it, I'm up, stop playin' with me, yeah
He get caught playin' games, recieve that fine, yeah
Shawty got a thing for them tunes, I been playin' her keys
Who's that peekin' in my motherfuckin' window?
Well, let them know that they on the fuckin' outside lookin' in, though
Out that N-O, and I don't look out my window
'Cause all I see is the shitshow
I fuck all of my ho friends, but I don't fuck on my friend's ho
'Less he toss that bitch, but fuck that bitch, let's fuck the world
That yopper shot a hundred times, felt like I did a hundred curls
Your Wonder Woman wonderin' why your wonderland ain't wonderworld
I jump inside her underworld, made her cum a hundred pearls
She pussy pop in the back to "Window Shoppin'"
Tinted windows, let the windows hide me
Crack the window, barrel stickin' out, it's stick 'em up
Lit 'em up, roll windows up, the window wipers off
I work the TEC like Window Microsoft, my windows on defrost

Eyes out my window
Tryna make sure that these niggas don't get one in, though
I'm inside this bitch with extendos
No love, no loss, so
Can't depend on niggas
Wrist out left my hand cold
What you think I'm tryna win for?

That whip cost money, I ain't lyin'
My mama said I did it, I'm up, stop playin' with me, yeah
He get caught playin' games, receive that fine, yeah
Shawty got a thing for them tunes, I been playin' her keys
Who's that peekin' in my window? Bah
Nobody know, nobody know12Embed
