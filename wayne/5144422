3 ContributorsI Can Only Imagine (David Guetta & Daddy’s Groove Remix) Lyrics
If we touched, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like, like


If we touched, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like, like
