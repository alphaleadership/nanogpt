Turn the music up
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

Tattoos on my face, nigga
Grill shinin' in your face, nigga
Blowin' smoke in your face, nigga
Hoes smilin' in my face, nigga
Your ho smilin' in my face, nigga
She out of line, she out of place, nigga
Everybody know my face, nigga
All eyes on me, get the mace, nigga
Uh, bad bitch with the face glitter
Snoop Dogg, murder was the case, nigga
Yeah, my homie got a open case, nigga
We in this bitch lookin' like a open safe, nigga

Uh, lookin' like an open safe, nigga
We in this bitch lookin' like a open safe, nigga
Yeah, if it's beef, we over-ate, nigga
Bap, bap, bap, bap, we don't debate, nigga
Yeah, there go the bass, nigga
You niggas starve, we let food go to waste, nigga
Choke your punk ass out, neck brace nigga
I do the same shit I learned on sex-tapes with her
New money, call it cake, fresh-baked, nigga
Hungry, bullets eatin' off your chest-plate, nigga
I hope this bitch don't think that I'ma have faith in her
Bitch screamed when the dick was halfway in her, huh
You might also like
When the dick was halfway in her
Ain't seen in her in a while, her ass way bigger
In the coupe, hitting corners like a maze, nigga
Banging Franklin, Beverly and mace, nigga
Damn, you ain't dead yet? I'm amazed, nigga
Guess what? I'm coming back with that gauge, nigga
Leather face, but I’m feeling like suede nigga
You dizzy, from turning over in your grave, nigga
I'm 5'5" stuntin' like I'm 5'8", nigga
I can shoot this bitch and still drive straight, nigga
My place don't need no fucking high gates, nigga
You in this bitch, looking like live bait, nigga

Looking like an open safe, nigga
We in this bitch lookin' like a open safe, nigga
I see your wife done chose a fake nigga
Bap, bap, bap, bap, we don't debate, nigga
Yeah, there go the bass, nigga
You niggas starve, we let food go to waste, nigga
Choke your punk ass out, neck brace nigga
Kidnap the cute baby, kill the babysitter
New money, call it cake, fresh-baked, nigga
Hungry, bullets eatin' off your chest-plate, nigga
I hope this bitch don't think that I'ma have faith in her
'Cause pay cuts bleed through the Band-Aid, nigga
I stick your hand in the fan blades, nigga
That's when you told me where your man stayed, nigga
I ran up in that bitch on a rampage, nigga
In the morning, brains in the pancakes, nigga
I'm a made nigga, you a man-made nigga
Walk it like you talk it, sashay, nigga
I take my goons out to see some landscape, nigga
We smoking parmesan, smoking handshake, nigga
My bitch classy and she keep her classmates with her
Your bitch ashy and she keep a ashtray with her
Had to do it one time for my skate niggas
Fuck them niggas that be hating 'cause I stayed, nigga

Looking like an open safe, nigga
Know the feds tryna lock this open safe, nigga
Fuck it, I feel like a frozen lake nigga
Bap, bap, bap, bap, we don't debate with her
Uh, no bass, nigga
Only smoking gas, no brakes, nigga
Yeah, me and money so amazed, nigga
She get my name tatted, letters bold face

When we shoot, we don't race
We gon' need our own space
Need a piece of that pie, we gon' need it homemade
I be coming home late, bad bitch long face
She do every single thing but rub me the wrong way
'96 Dom P, I have that with Corn Flakes
And I never been a intrigued by the patterns on snakes
Need to dump a dead body, man I think I know a place
She gon' suck the prototype and swallow all the protoges, nigga
Lookin' like a open safe, nigga
We in this bitch lookin' like a open safe, nigga
Yeah, my homie got a open case, nigga
Celebrating like he got a cold case, nigga
Yeah, haha, there go the bass, nigga
Come to the hood, show you how to motor chase, nigga
Choke your punk ass out, neck brace nigga
I just bought a plastic Glock, less weight, nigga
New money, call it cake, fresh-baked, nigga
Make a movie in this bitch, press play, nigga
I hope this bitch don't think that I'ma have faith in her
Time out let the hourglass break, nigga

Wait nigga, had to take a smoke break, nigga
Yeah, smoke break, nigga
Okay nigga, I just left José nigga, I just left José, nigga
Federales on my ass, fucking had a boat chase, nigga
They didn't see no face, nigga
Your bitch spent the whole day with us
And niggas know we don't play, nigga
Nigga, don't play that shit like cocaine, nigga, we on
Homies pump that bass, nigga
Lookin' like a open safe, nigga
But there ain't no code to break niggas
I capitalize off my own mistakes
You lowercase, nigga
Your bitch cut her legs when they was on my shoulder blades, nigga
Don't hate (Don't hate) call an ace, an ace, nigga
Got Mack with me up in this bitch, brought Nina just in case, nigga
Baby Scarface, nigga, fuck the human race, nigga
Bap, bap, bap, bap, we don't debate with em
