4 ContributorsWho Can I Trust Lyrics
Yo
What's up
That gangster shit
For real, for reala shit
Guerilla war, what?
Yo
What? Guerilla war what?
What, for real, Hot Boys, nigga
Yo

Yo, I write rhymes for niggas at nighttime
Consider your life mines
Whether you pumping five packs or five pies
Montana living it my persona imminent
Real niggas don’t keep beef, we finish it
No retreat no surrendering
No rocking me to sleep
I keep the heat up in my premises
A whole different level of rhymes
Several of my competitors tried
Coming better than mines
Verbally in way ahead of my time
Mega in glamourized through words
Son in living off the dimes you served
Staying focused keeping an eye open for stray vultures
Everybody got to go every day is a day closer
I’m soaking in my sofa, reminiscing Tony coked up
Life is fucked up, even when you blow up
You might also like
Who can you trust?
Only a few and my nine I bust
What do you lust
The money and the power nigga
Who you respect
All my niggas that’s no longer with us
And all the drug kingpins that showed us how to get it
Who can you trust?
Only a few and my nine I bust
Now, what do you lust
The money and the power nigga
Say, who you respect
All my niggas that’s no longer with us
And all the drug kingpins that showed us how to get it

Yo, who the nicest nigga spitting the trife shit
Ghetto drama saga is for niggas wit' indictments
Flipping white shit, screaming, "Fuck the feds"
Squeezing your heat at police 'til you cuffed to your hospital bed
Thug general, write rhymes for criminals to listen to
If you ain't real my shit ain't even meant for you
My pen stains the paper like blood
My mind is like a nine and my rhymes are like a slug
Before I snitch like a bitch I'd rather die like a thug
If they arraign me for banging I throw my signal at the judge
I’m almighty
Defy me 'til these four fours beside me
Red light to guide me to your vital point
With my heater I anoint
You a second from death
My only regret is that I emptied out my whole clip
Being sulk beyotch
Who can you trust?
Only a few and my nine I bust
What do you lust
The money and the power nigga
Who you respect
All my niggas that’s no longer with us
And all the drug kingpins that showed us how to get it
Who can you trust?
Only a few and my nine I bust
Now, what do you lust
The money and the power nigga
Say, who you respect
All my niggas that’s no longer with us
And all the drug kingpins that showed us how to get it

To my thugs, its unconditional love
I’m giving you, I've been in and out the motherfucking system too
Hunger pains when I was younger made me ready to face
Consequences of life the street fed me
Ready rock chopped the punk that bought my high top dunks
And crack fiends sold me a baby nah, hold up
This ain't some shit I just made up in a rhyme this the realness
In a reflection of a sinner I spit
Yo feel this
My name alone have me maintaining a phone on a come through
Not to mention a banger I hold
Ain't nothing new why the fuck would I front for you
I'm a felony offender, you showing your jealousy nigga
Who can you trust?
Only a few and my nine I bust
What do you lust
The money and the power nigga
Who you respect
All my niggas that’s no longer with us
And all the drug kingpins that showed us how to get it
Who can you trust?
Only a few and my nine I bust
Now, what do you lust
The money and the power nigga
Say, who you respect
All my niggas that’s no longer with us
And all the drug kingpins that showed us how to get it

Who can I trust? Word up nigga
Hot Boy nigga, Cash Money nigga, guerilla war nigga
Get it right and keep it right
You need to be down to get up, for real
