21 ContributorsSmoke Sumthin (Remix) Lyrics
Just in case you need something else to roll to
Spitta, Weezy, Dram'
You know we go way back like Tony, Toni, Tone
Tryna keep dirt off my rims
Verde Terrace
These motherfuckers got me fucked up
Verde Terrace (Yeah, yeah)

One for the money, yessir, two for the show
But I ain't steppin on the stage until they count up all my cash flow
Oh man, then your man's going Twilight Zone
Wantin' to be left alone, again at home, listen to Soulja Slim
I spread that dough out, rolling pin, slice it up with my closest friends
As the grimy globe spins, I'm riding, tryna keep dirt off my rims and my name
Out'chea stay poppin up at the red carpet
My green Tahoe, with my Las Vegas bitch and one of your hoes
Highed up, I like what she working with, that's why we hired her
We put her on the set, tattoo calligarphy letter "Jets"
Love and respect, we passing you the fuck up
Ain't passing you none of my bud, that's why you standing 'round us bruh!
Are you accounted for? Who brung you?
You don't speak the code bro, your slick tongue done hung you
You walking down the aisle with the same bitches we run through
I'm in the bank line, empire
I build this for us to eat, inside—this the lunch room
Outside is looking wild and hungry fool
Shut the door so they don't see us; light a joint or two...
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Got stopped in the mall the other day
I heard a call from the other way
Where I just came from, some nigga was saying something
Talking about "Smoke sumthin'" (Smoke sumthin')
Got stopped in the mall the other day
I heard a call from the other way
Where I just came from, some bitches was saying something
Talking about "Smoke sumthin'"

Yeah, uh-huh
I do just that
Turn the music up, Mike
(Gangsta!)

Let me gon' light me one up for all my trouble
I'm chillin with this bitch who think we make the perfect couple
But she trippin, I'm sippin on some bubbly with no bubbles
It's me, that's who, I put this shit together like puzzles
I'm puzzled: is it me or niggas is lame?
You're coward-hearted, yellow, lemon merengue
I'm about to change my name from "Dwayne" to "Deranged"
To be a billionaire, I got a shot, like Danny Ainge
My gang wear red, your bitch a airhead
But I still break her off like a fucking chair leg
And Tunechi, ya heard me, you don't deserve me
Swag so sick, so, injury reserve me
I'm the god, I should be rapping in a turban
But knowing me, I'll prob'ly ollie up the curb
Then grind down the rail only with my tail
Pause— Haha
Got stopped in the mall the other day
I heard a call from the other way
Where I just came from, some nigga was saying something (Owww!)
Talking about "Smoke sumthin'" (Young Money)
Got stopped in the mall the other day
I heard a call from the other way
Where I just came from, some bitches was saying something
Talking about "Smoke sumthin'"

Bitch, you ain't putting on
Smoke sumthin'
Like Too Short say
"I remember when you couldn't even smoke shit, gotta stay focused"8Embed
