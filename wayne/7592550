18 ContributorsCameras Lyrics
Uh, I'ma go stupid on this Pi’erre beat
I'm in Miami, I'm in the water
Bad bitch booty hangin' off of the jetski
I turned a Camry to a Ferrari
Before I fucked her, bitch stop playin' with a rich nigga
She say she ticklish, she get her clit tickled
Make her pussy lips giggle
Figured this shit out at a young age
Tell a op I'm unfazed
Put you on the front page
I got niggas that'll take you out for $1K
One thing for sure, two thing for certainly
You pussy niggas be irking me
That's why I get higher than Mercury
She only take her mask off when she's slurpin' mе
Uh, yeah
Don't jump in that water if you ain't with the swimming
Don't opеn your mouth if you ain't at the dentist
Don't shoot at the ground and complain about missin'
I'm smoking that loud but the draco be whisperin'
I got a silencer on it
You just hear pew-pew-pew-pew-pew
Put a bug in your ear the size of a hornet
Grind from the morning till the next morning
Lay the money down and have sex on it, yeah
Fuck a broke nigga, flex on him
Brand new cocaine, never stepped on
Ball like Rogaine, nigga, that's balling
Bought her a night stand, nigga I spoiled her
Bust down white thing lookin' like tartar
All this rose on lookin' like a a garden, nigga
Yeah, Jordan, nigga
Keep that Tommy with me like I'm Martin, nigga
I ain't spittin', I'm barfin', nigga
I ain't litty, I'm arson, nigga (Woah)

They want the lights and the cameras
But they wasn't 'bout all the action (Woah)
She love the lights and the cameras
She wants it aggressive, not passive (Woah)
I flew her out from Atlanta
Ooh, my lil' baby a savage (Woah)
It's going down in the Benzo
She threw it back like a classic
I can't get caught up in passion (Yee)
Turn my regrets into ashes (Yee)
I put every beat in a casket (Yee)
Been running this shit, no Patrick (Yee)
Look, I ain't in no need of no passes (Woah)
Chiefing on gas, and we ain't the same
No, we ain't gon' bash it
Never been average
