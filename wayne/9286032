1 ContributorCaught A Striper Lyrics(Verse 1 Lil Tjay):
Bitch I
Go Now
Nigga Head
Won't Now
(Chorus Lil B):
This Is The Time That I Caught A Striper!
This Is The Time That I Caught A Striper!
This Is The Time That I Caught A Striper!
This Is The Time That I Caught A Striper!
(Verse 2 Lil Wayne):
I'm a feen for the green yea I'm addicted to money
I gotta feed my addiction that fat bitch is hungry
Since a youngin I've realized it's all about the benjamins
I like Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson
But every day I'm constantly disrespecting them
Cause I stay wipeing my ass with dead presidents
I am a vetеran spitting better than all of thesе rookies
They think they harder than woodies but they softer than pussy
I'm like a big red button u really don't wanna push me
I stay with the burner I'm always ready to cook beef
(Chorus Lil B & Toxic):
This Is The Time That I Caught A Striper!
This Is The Time That I Caught A Striper!
This Is The Time That I Caught A Striper!
This Is The Time That I Caught A Striper!
(Toxic):
This Is The Time That I Caught A Striper!
This Is The Time That I Caught A Striper!
