1 ContributorAIN’T GONNA ANSWER (Sped Up) Lyrics
Don't be worried 'bout what we be doin'
What we doin'? Makin' money
What they doin'? Hatin' on us
If they want it, take it from me
What them other niggas doin'?
I don't know 'cause I don't stunt 'em
Mind my business, on my mama
Fuck a nigga how I'm comin'

Big booty bitch, made her back her ass up (Back that ass up)
Shots out the switch made him bag his man up (Bag his man up)
Say that she yo' bitch, she my private dancer (Private dancer)
You can call her phone, but she ain't gon' answer (Ain't gon' answer)

Go, go, go, go
Known to turn a bitch up, I'm talkin' way past the ceiling go
She fuck with me because these karats like a rabbit, silly ho
My nigga pop Percocets, bike like a wheelie, ho
From the city of Memphis, we known for mackin' and pimpin'
But I'm a hot boy, I can't lie, I got some Weezy up in me
You know this shit, it get greasy, I'm in the streets like a meter
She tellin' me that she need me, but Lord know that she a eater
Ayy, tell 'em, "Drop his nuts," he holding too much tension in his balls
Made 'em run a four flat, but he was six feet tall
Like a high school ho, I'm tryna hit all y'all
Yeah, I seen 'em stumble, but I'm tryna make 'em fall, fall
Shake it, she was fully dressed, now she naked (Naked)
Backshots, front shots, makin' bitch shapeshift (Shapeshift)
Ready for the cumshot, told her to taste it (Taste it)
Bad bitches chase me, I use to fuck basics (Basics)
She askin' for my raw dawg, ho, you get a latex (Latex)
Ball deep in her mouth, make a bitch say less (Say less)
Swallow my nut or yo' friend the replacement ('Placement)
Put her on her knees, yeah, I call that good graces
You might also like
Don't be worried 'bout what we be doin'
What we doin'? Makin' money
What they doin'? Hatin' on us (Hatin' on us)
If they want it, take it from me (Take it)
What them other niggas doin'?
I don't know 'cause I don't stunt 'em
Mind my business, on my mama
Fuck a nigga how I'm comin'

Big booty bitch, made her back her ass up (Back that ass up)
Shots out the switch made him bag ass man up (Bag his man up)
Say that she yo' bitch, she my private dancer—

She said, "Come here," she said, "Get here"
She said, "Stop playing, nigga, bring that dick here," ooh
I got bitches waitin' to see me like a premiere, ooh
And her mouth be full of semen, look like veneers, ooh
Don't be worried 'bout what I'm doin'
Don't be worried 'bout who I'm doin'
Don't be worried 'bout who I flew in or these Percocets I'm chewin'
All these Birkins and this Louis got her twerkin' that lil' booty
She said, "Throw that dick Lil Tunechi," she gon' catch it like a movie
I be X'ing bitches out, leave her at that nigga house
Never thought I'd leave my kids until I left them in her mouth
I be stretchin' bitches out, you be stressin' bitches out
I'm like Lionel Messi, kickin' messy bitches out
Girl, you workin' with some ass, yeah, I smack it with my backhand
Ooh, she got that fat cat, I give that cat the cat scan
From a hot boy to a madman, that high-water or hell deep
Call him NLE, you can call me, "Machiavelli"
Shirt off, chopper on, Weezy baby, Babylon
I'm greedy, baby, Ramadan
Got my slimes with me, it's a slime-a-thon
Wake up with Balenciaga pajamas on with two bitches
Check my phone, nude pictures
I check your ass like the new Twitter (Tunechi)
Don't be worried 'bout what we be doin'
What we doin'? Makin' money
What they doin'? Hatin' on us
If they want it, take it from me
What them other niggas doin'?
I don't know 'cause I don't stunt 'em
Mind my business, on my mama
Fuck a nigga how I'm comin'

Big booty bitch, made her back her ass up (Back that ass up)
Shots out the switch, made him bag his man up (Bag his ass up)
Say that she yo' bitch she my private dancer
You can call her phone and I'll probably answer, nigga

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Haha, Mula, Baby)
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, goEmbed
