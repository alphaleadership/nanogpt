10 ContributorsTil She Lose Her Voice Lyrics
Yeah
Scoob in this bitch with me
But this about you
Ooh, let's go

Girl, you know I love you, and I'm there for you
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for you
I got some candles lit and some underwear for you
Them edible underwear, I ate a pair for you
Ooh, now she on a handstand (Ooh), I'm her number one fan (Ooh)
She the intelligent one, I'm just me with my dumb ass (Oh)
She a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her (Twerk with her)
She ain't got a lot of ass, but I could work with her (With her)

'Cause she shake it like a dog, hop like a frog
Ride it like a horse, scream and holler 'til she lose her voice
Yeah, she shake it like a dog, hop like a frog
Ride it like a horse, so I ain't got a choice
She pop it like a tart, and stab it like a heart
She sad when we depart, she watching her remarks
And she said, "We gon' ride this shit on out, if not, we walk"
I said, "Fuckin' right," ooh baby, ooh baby

She said, "Ignore them hoes, better not"
She said, "Them hoes, better not fuck with my Tunechi
He got a magic stick and know how to use it"
She said, "Them hoes, better not fuck with my Tunechi
He got a magic stick and know how to use it," Uhh

She a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got a lot of ass, but I could work with her
She a slim, fine woman with some shit with her
She ain't got a lot of ass, but she pretty as fuck
And she can shake it like a dog, shake it like a dog
Shake it like a, now take that dog for a walk
And want you walk it like a, serve it like a, bounce it like a, yeah
Walk it like a, serve it like a, bounce it like a, yeah

Girl, you know I love you and I care for you
Girl, you know I love you, I go hard for you, it's from the heart
Girl, you gotta monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Act a donkey on that dick, pony on that shit
Let me see you monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Act a donkey on that dick, pony on that shit, girl, you gotta
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya
Just ask my bitch about me, I got her a belt Vuitton
And this dick is A1, pussy well-done
And she say, "Ooh baby, ooh baby"

She said, "Ignore them hoes, better not"
She said, "Them hoes better not fuck with my Tunechi
