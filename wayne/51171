46 ContributorsDemolition Freestyle Part 1 Lyrics
Bodybag the beat, toe-tag the highs
 more bragging rights
If you ain't acting right, send you to afterlife
I'm the action type, shoot, mash, and fight
I ball like Steve Nash and shoot past the light
And jump all in a freak ass, she getting smashed tonight
I'm a vulture, nigga, slicker than a snake
I'm a fool, I'm a ape and you food
I am raping you fools
Murk shit, on the track I molest you rappers
Wayne and Gudda—who wanna contest the rappers?
No bodies, four shottys, get the job done
No problem, I been a beast since Sqad 1
My money runnin' like Sonic the Hedgehog
And for the bread, dog, I'm like Adolph
H—Hitler, gimme the money or meet the sizzler
I'm a toaster like Strudels, Ima burn these niggas, yeah

And I don't wanna talk about it
Gangsta shit right in front you, nigga, walk around it
Nigga, let me do me
They know I kick it like Jet Li, Bruce Lee
And I've done what they can't do
Me, I'll put my gun up to your Aunt Suzie
And blow out a doobie, paint her ruby
I am a loony, you niggas puny
I puke on the beat, I juke and never fumble
Man, I spit that dope, like I swallowed a bundle
Gotta spit that dope up
'Cause the old heads said, "If you don't, it'll bust"
I heard if I sell it hard, it'll rush
But if them people come, if it's soft, it'll flush
Haha! Certainly
Don't get caught in the blind, and keep your curtain straight
No, I don't drink wine but I smoke purple, grape
Sometimes, see purple stars—I ain't talking about purple Bapes
I gets paid early 'cause I be workin' late
Too many painful memories, shit hurt to say
Crack flow: no bake, just stir and shake
Shooting when we pull up like Urkel waist
Sip syrup, got me moving at a turtle pace
But quick, draw, pop out like a turtle face, haha
Paid in full, you can't murk the ace
I kill your beat, then beat the murder case, haha, yeah
That's right, I'ma kill this shit
And if the glove don't fit, I'ma need a catcher's mitt
'Cause I'm high like a bitch, yeah I'm high like a bitch
Like Mariah and shit, I guess I'm higher than a bitch
Keep it dirty like I'm lying in the ditch
Like Eli, I'm from New Orleans, I'm a Giant in this bitch
Move the G and add an S and put the I before the N
And put the A in front of that, and that's what I am to the end
That's a Saint, motherfucker, simplify it for them
Where your funeral comes with a secondline at the end, yeah
But you won't be secondlining with them
'Cause you'll be in the hearse that's behind all of them, yeah
I see your homies dressed in black like they finna ride
But that fashion statement is telling a lie
I'm pelican fly, Mac-11 inside
My bullets come with wings, and your cerebellum can fly
Yeah, fucking right, oh, yeah
Young Money, we are, sick as gonorrhea
Like nausea, heart burn, indigestion
Upset, stomach, and diarrhea
Get some Pepto-Bismo', ho!
