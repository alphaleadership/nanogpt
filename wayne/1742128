4 ContributorsOut Here Grindin (Remix) Lyrics
I don't care what nobody say, I'ma be me (be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nuttin with nobody
Homie I gotta get me me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nuttin' to me, 'cause I am the streets

I seldom got hated but it's typical now
But like a gumball, I'm sticking around
I'm getting it now, lyrics by the pound
If money really talks, my figures is loud
I'm making an entrance, fashionably late
Blew out the candles, made a wish, and then bit in the cake
I've been making what they, couldn't make if they payed
Meter write it for them, fuck it, I'll ship 'em a 
Ghost write for racks, I'll ghost write your tracks
I'll keep it on the hush, I bet you coming back
Snow White kickback relax, nah baby never that
The album coming soon, this mixtape just a jab
I got 'em thinking fast, but still react slow
It's me to blame, don't go crazy it's irrational
I'm out here grinding hard, so bitch keep up
There's only one reaction when I rap: "Jesus!"

I don't care what nobody say, I'ma be me (be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nuttin with nobody
Homie I gotta get me me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nuttin' to me, 'cause I am the streets

W-E T-H-E B-E-S-T
DJ Khaled (We The Best!)

A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-fucking P
Look, what the fuck do I care if Boosie can spell?
Ask me about it, I think he bootsie as hell
This the Product movement, and look we moving it well
The checks come to me, um, the proof in the mail
I'm the future of this, Hip Hop is mine
These rappers getting old and look me, I got the time
If y'all have a new rappers roster, you ought to write
Me in it 'cause now I'm here
It gotta be modified
Ha ha, I'm
Something like
A helicopter  so fly the chopper right
So ahead of my time, even the  surprised
'Cause I just ripped Boosie work, and I forgot to try
And we are the best
And Weezy be the shhh like two H's after S
I got these niggas on shhh like I gon' deaf
And I'm right right, and you're wrong left
Hahahah, check out this bizarre
I am regularly irregular
Khaled best DJ, Weezy best rapper
If Khaled say it's a movie then Weezy best actor

I don't care what nobody say, I'ma be me (be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nuttin with nobody
Homie I gotta get me me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nuttin' to me, 'cause I am the streets

I'm a go-getter, entrepreneur, motherfuckin' hustler
If you wanna come and  there's a potential customer
If you ain't talk about green or cha-ching, nigga I won't fuck wit ya
Children in this game, and I'm the , you still can't touch me bruh
On another level, need a ladder just to step up
Even if your name was , you couldn't catch up
My game is getting stronger, always striving to get better
I'm a master of my craft, that's why I'm always getting cheddar
'Bout my dollars so it makes sense that I stay at 
But the way my verse can  pay attention to these beats
Out here grinding' in the West but flipping chips up in the East
I'm the H- makin' money everyday, you call me B-I-Z
And in case you can't spell, that means I'm the business
Bitch I spit laxative flows because I am the shit
Best believe it, that I'm never leaving' yo
I'm blessing these streets like 
I don't care what nobody say, I'ma be me (be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nuttin with nobody
Homie I gotta get me me (cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nuttin' to me, 'cause I am the streetsEmbed
