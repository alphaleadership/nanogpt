3 ContributorsLook at Me Now (Cover) Lyrics
Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you doin' that thang over there, homie
Let's go!

'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, I pick it gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing that they could think that they be doin'
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple kids
That I'm always winning and then I gotta get it again and again and again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, I think I better call a ref
And everybody know my style and they know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it

Yeah
I'm done with that!
Done with thatEmbed
