8 ContributorsMarch N’ Step LyricsAhh they shouldn't a done this right here
March now step now march now step (yeah)
March now step now march now step (blueberry still connect)
March now step now march now step
March now step now march now step

You gotta march like a soldier
Walk it how you talk it
Play it how you say it and stop acting on that hard shit
Stripes on my back is what ya boy go to war wit
Never been faking or fronting or on that fraud shit
You gotta march like a soldier (now on my block we just march)
You gotta walk it like you talk it (we got the lil mamas dipping)
You gotta march like a soldier (now on my block we just march)
You gotta walk it like you talk it (we got the lil mamas dipping)

I'm grinding
I'm posted up on the block like a stop sign
Raised off of instinct with a mind like Einstein
I'm a certified hustler and a G
Trying to metamorphasize a hundred two a hundred three
I'm chasing after currency and accumulating green
With the heart of a lion, I'm on the grind like a dope fien
I've got the street smarts of Avon Barksdale
I took a couple hits but I'm still flowing like blood cells
My money's epidemic, it multiply fast
I'm grinding in the cut like a piece of broken glass
Addicted to the hustle allergic to being broke
Never falling off cuz I stay on my note
You might also like
You gotta march like a soldier (now all my hot boys march)
You gotta walk it like you talk it (we got the hot girls dipping)
You gotta march like a soldier (now all my hot boys march)
You gotta walk it like you talk it (we got the hot girls dipping)

Ayy, get off my dick, Hollygroove Weezy
Young Money billionaire, Hermès winter ware
I'm trying to get somewhere like I ain't never been nowhere
They probably suffocate trying to breathe this Indo air
Halt, who goes there? Nigga, I live there
I run on top of water, I walk on thin air
I ride around with a MAC10 squared
That's a pair of semi-automatics shootin everywhere
I don't care if authority come by here
They get it just like them niggas who ain't from by here
Yeah, and I'm extra 'bout it
If I get in beef, I do something about it 'fore I get out
Yeah, Lil Wayne never dropped the "Lil"
I gave Paul a hundred thousand for my grill, yeah
I'm so New Orleans that I can't hide
You know I'm cutting something I'm spittin for Roc side, Weezy

You gotta march like a soldier (now all my dope boys march)
You gotta walk it like you talk it (we got the dope girls dipping)
You gotta march like a soldier (now all my dope boys march)
You gotta walk it like you talk it (we got the dope girls dipping)
I ain't never had a hand, I ain't never been a beggar
On the grind like a bootlegger, I'm a go getter (Real)
I'm Bobby Fischer on the mic making chess moves
This suckers playin checkers simply destined to lose
The Martha Stewart made it blind and the James Bonds pens
Me and a couple lady friends blowing piff in the wind
I got the wristwear, smooth and sleek, nothing but Patek Philippe
You ain't never saw a watch like this so go ahead and take a peek
I'm massive in the streets like a diesel truck
Indulging in that purple stuff gettin full of that puff-puff
Tote the iron, I'm double dutch, I'm ice water up in the clutch
Place your bet, I'll call ya bluff, Paul Wall baby that's whats up

You gotta march like a soldier (now all my dope boys march)
You gotta walk it like you talk it (we got the dope girls dipping)
You gotta march like a soldier (now all my dope boys march)
You gotta walk it like you talk it (we got the dope girls dipping)1Embed
