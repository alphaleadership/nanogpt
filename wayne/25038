5 ContributorsSet It Off (Remix Radio) Lyrics
(Okay) Uh-huh (Uh-huh), okay (Mm-hm), uh-huh
(Mmhmm) Street mix (Street mix)
(Uh-huh) Listen, listen, listen
(Ladies and gentleman!)

Okay I'm Weezy Wee the man and I reps it well
And it's gon' be Cash Money whether death or jail
Catch me flossin' in the hood, tryna to get at ya girl
Or in a Porsche like a bat out of hell, vroooom
Now I'ma tell ya how it is and no matter the cost
Respect me or get a shot to where you gather your thoughts
Got a Escalade wavin' on them deep dish rims
And got ya girl sayin', "We just friends", I ain't trippin'
I'ma do it for my city so ya gotta get with it
Blue-eyed Bentley, knew I'd get it, uh-huh
From the streets of the dirty, it's humid and muddy
We get money or it get bloody, ya heard me?
I got some freaks on my side that you'll like
And somethin' on my wrist colder than a Coors Light
It's SQ-7 CMB it's life
It's Hot Boy forever Weezy Wee get right, uh-huh
(Ladies and gentleman!)

See Juvenile LiveGet tickets as low as $81You might also like
I'm the number one stunna Baby, B, Bryan, and Bubba
Got that Crist' in my hand, a pistol in the other
Ol' Ignant Hot Boy 'bout to get in some trouble
Plus I'm leanin' off the liquor, bout to get at your woman
I'm runnin' with them HPG's, them Uptown thugs
I ain't buyin' the bar homey I'm buyin' the club
So momma look, get chea, show me whassup
Put some straightenin' on them dubs, and show me some love
Like Hennessy, , clean, G
You gotta admit it that's the way it's supposed to be
I'm the bird man homey and I'm sellin' them cheaps
Put hits on bustas while I'm brushin' my teefs
Can't quit this now cause you done played it too strong
Stunna Corleone 'til I'm dead and gone
One love to them Hot Boys, sellin' that wrong
And my homies in the pen, from usin' they phones

Look, forget what ya heard dawg, Turk still thuggin'
You got me messed up, bout to make me start bustin'
Trust me, I don't miss cousin
And the last thing you see is fire and blood gushin'
I'm a lil' thug, always strapped with that thang
You get killed thug, when you're messin' with me main
I run with real soldiers called the B.G.F
Ready for anything you could believe that dere
I guess it's in us to be the way that we be
We all from Uptown, from the 3 'til the 13th
We tote choppers, with a hundred in 'em
And you see them dope shops we bout, runnin' in 'em
We play it raw, give a know what about the law
They get stole too when they, messin' with us
My team still strong, we all from the hood
CMR for life, come between? Wish you would
