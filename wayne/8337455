1 ContributorPlease Donâ€™t Go, Go Lyrics
I am a fighter
I keep on movin' on
As if there's nothin' standin' in my way
I keep on longin'
I keep on comin' back for more
Our last night is endin'
Let's keep on dancin'
Let's keep on movin' on
As if there's nothin' preventin' the new day
From tears of cryin'
Let's keep on livin' more and more
No, baby, please don't go, go, go, go, go

Don't let me go
Oh, no, no, oh, please don't let us go
I wanna know
Do you wanna go?
Please don't go, go, go, go, go
Don't let me go
No, no, no, no, please don't let us go
I wanna know
Like, do you wanna go?
Oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, go, go

Give me a hundred bricks and I'm outta here
Word to Holly Grove, I'ma get 'em outta here (Let it go)
Syrup and hydro, can't get a pop (Let it go, let it go)
We smell like footas, stick like snot
Yeah, fuck them, I'm hot
What, where, and when? Nigga, I been that nigga
Yeah, that's right, but you cook great, like Mom (Let it go, let it go)
Fuck up the work and get that hook, left, right, Mom (Let it go)
Come on, push that button, nigga
Bring it 'round here, we'll go at it tonight, nigga
Checkin', this icy niggas, it's shiesty niggas (Let it go, let it go)
That got buns and the cops on 'em, other stocks on 'em (Let it go)
I'm out wylin', baby, pray for 'em
Don't cry for 'em, wait for 'em, keep the lights on (Let it go)
Have a close-off, bitch, it's been a long day (Let it go, let it go)
Tomorrow mornin', back at it, bitch, first day, yeah

Don't let me go
Oh, no, no, oh, please don't let us go
I wanna know
Why do you wanna go?
Oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, go, go

Oh
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Don't let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Go, go, go, go, go
Original, a lot of style, boom-pow
Blowin' on the pound, wha-pa-pa-pa-pow
Way up in the cloud, misbehave your flave'
Now let me show you how to maintain (Go)
It's a stain as I crush game
Smooth as silk, with a little bit of kush, mane
Plushtane, lavish livin'
Bust on the pigs with bad intentions
Smoke dope, bro for bro, Diango
The homie said, "9-1-1 is a joke"
And I believe that, so I protect this Earth
Every nigga on the block has my word
Cadillac drivin', stack at the Bible
Listen to the sounds of the sirens, I'm an OG nigga on a mission
Fiends gon' burn in the kitchen, I'm twistin' while dippin'
And crippin' (Crippin')

Don't let me go (And let me show you how)
Oh, no, no, oh, please don't let us go
I wanna know
Why do you wanna go?
Oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, go, go

Go
Let it go, let it go, let it go (Yeah, yeah, that's right)
Go
Let it go, let it go, let it go (Listen to the sounds of the sirens)
Oh
Let it go, let it go, let it go (Yeah, yeah, that's right)
Don't wanna go
Oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, go, goEmbed
