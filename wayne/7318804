1 Contributor$tep LyricsEvery-time
I step with my bloody sneakers
And my fuckin heater
I fuck your bitch
But I don’t keep her
I smoke that green
Feelin like a creeper
Hunnid bands
Stacked the benji man
Let this bitches know who I am
Throw this money she gone dance
Shawty trippin’ poppin xans
She gon make it clap
Throw it back to the gang, ay
But I stick to my plan, ay
Tryna run up these bands, ay
He talk about us
He got banged,ay
Don’t fuck around the gang, ay
Bitch You gonna get hanged, ay
When this choppa speaks it don’t lag
I get money slow or fast
Shoot like curry
30 on the strap
Got your bitch
On my lap
I ain’t playing games
Your shawty bust my brains
She a thotty under the frame
Shе don’t love me but it’s okay
You might also likeI can pull up anyday
I slide and hit likе 808
I ain’t a killer but don’t play
My killers gonna spray everywhere I say
Put you in the grave
Couple of shots to your Brain
Hunnid shots you can’t defend
When we shoot We don’t play
My choppa Fuck up anybody
It dont discriminate
Every-time
I step with my bloody sneakers
And my fuckin heater
I fuck your bitch
But I don’t keep her
I smoke that green
Feelin like a creeper
Hunnid bands
Stacked the benji man
Let this bitches know who I am
Throw this money she gone dance
Shawty trippin’ poppin xans
She gon make it clap
Throw it back to the gang, ay
But I stick to my plan, ay
Tryna run up these bands, ay
He talk about us
He got banged,ay
Don’t fuck around the gang, ay
Bitch You gonna get hanged, ay
Man I don’t give a fuck about your bros
Pull up with that 44
Choppa hit your door
Bitch I’m pressing alone
I ain’t stressing about no hoe
Hit her once then I’m gone
She keep blowing up my phone
Bitch we ain’t getting along
I’m Done with these hoes

Fell in love with draco
This shit blast his face off
When this shit coughs, bodies drop
Imma shoot when I catch a opp
Bitch who gon stop meEmbed
