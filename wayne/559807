5 ContributorsGirls Forever Lyrics
She said, "Oh"
She said, "Woo"
I said, "So?"
She said, "No"
She said, "Go, you got to go"
I said, "I know"
She said, "No"

And every time I'm with this chick
We fuck like we in a relationship
I want to stay forever, but

I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again
The Tina's and the Gina's
The Lisa's and Teresa's
The Keyshia's and Alishia's
I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again
The Judy's and the Suzy's
The Stacy's and the Tracy's
The Ana's and the Hannah's
I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again
Again, again
I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again

"Hey"
She said, "Hey"
I said, "Pay"
She said, "No Way"
I said, "Stay"
She said, "Wait"
She said, "Pay"
She said, "Stay"
Yeah

And every time I'm with this chick
We fuck like we in a relationship
I want to play forever, but

I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again
The Tina's and the Gina's
The Lisa's and Teresa's
The Keyshia's and Alishia's
I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again
The Judy's and the Suzy's
The Stacy's and the Tracy's
The Ana's and the Hannah's
I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again
Again, again
I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again
To meet a new friend
Just to find myself, I hide myself
Girl, so I guess I pretend
Like I'm into me
And the game open, with
The Tina's and the Gina's
The Lisa's and Teresa's
The Keyshia's and Alishia's, yeah
The Judy's and the Suzy's
The Stacy's and the Tracy's
The Ana's and the Diana's, yeah
The Ange's and the Tange's
The Tamie's and the Camie's
The Dora's and the Nora's-es, yeah
The Molly's and the Dolly's
The Maggie's and the Sandie's
The... Oooh

I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again
Again, again
I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again
I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again3Embed
