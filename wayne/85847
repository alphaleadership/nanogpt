Get high, get high, get high, get high, get high

Young Mula, baby!

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high

Nigga blowin' on that ayo (Ayo), breakin’ down them trees
I’m out the door with that dro and them keys
Scoopin' up Chris and I’m hittin' the freeway, yeah
Got a whole zip of that purp'
Got a couple hoes home with no clothes on
Get they roll on, let's twerk (Let's twerk)
Now we hotboxin' that Ghost (That Ghost)
Ace all in the door (That door)
Ray-Ban's on my face
Never know when my eyes low (Low)
Smoke good, fuck good
Eat good, steakhouse
She said Backwoods, kill Swishers
You eat, take out
Yeah, but I love fuckin' them redbones (Uh)
She country thick and that hair long
That pussy killer, she dead wrong
She went to Howard, her head strong
Her mama tall, so her legs long
She went to college and got her masters
Now she bringin' that bread home, roll up
See The Game LiveGet tickets as low as $163You might also like

It’s a celebration, all on the pole, they doin' the dance
Anticipatin', I’m feelin' your body
Hopin' that you would just give me a chance
Goddamn, babe, just hold your glass up for this toast
My cash up and your ass up and I'm the one that's tippin' the most
Tonight, on the Westside
And if you wanna roll, have the best fuckin night of your life
No lie, no lie
Me and you together, girl, I’m celebratin' you tonight
Uh, yeah, I’m blown, no cigarillo, 'rillo
Love when I'm mellow, get on my level
Hundred-one karats in my bezel
I’m on, like soon as the ice cream truck at the ghetto
Little knucklehead always in trouble
Soon as I ask shawty her number, fo' sho'
Yeah, I get it, then I'm gone
Then I hit it like bone-bone
Now you fuckin' up my zone
My zone, my zone
Said she waitin' for daddy come home
Told me she ain't got nothin' on
I’m talkin' no thong, th-thong, thong (Haha)
Yeah, she throwin' that ass back
Hard as a bat, sit on my lap
Fuckin' with me, ain't nothin' better than that
That’s a fact, that's a fact?
Don’t act Hollywood 'cause I don’t act
'Bout my business, but I don’t slack
This my celebration rap, so (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high (Yeah)
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
Uh, I pour up for Pimp C,light up for Soulja Slim
Straight out the gutter with the rest of the bowlin' pins
Money for days, bitches go both ways
On the road to riches, bitch, I got road rage
Got the kush in the Swisher, got the pussy, the liquor
Got a silencer on the gun, take it off like a stripper
Yeah, wake up, wake up, I’m goin' at your face, make up
These niggas need stitches 'cause they takin' pay cuts
Man, somebody tell them hoes it's a celebration
All my niggas got guns, no registration, yeah
Now gon' light that weed up
I’m TRUKFIX tee’d up, hoes down, B's up, Tunechi
Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I’m floatin', I'm gone
Put the purp' in the blunt (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I’m floatin', I'm gone
Put the purp' in the blunt (Young Moolah, baby!)
Haha
