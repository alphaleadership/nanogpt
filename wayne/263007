I tied dat bitch doesn my rhymes

First mixtape (yo) dame it's so
Smoothing

Ready 2 suck

Wen i throw my lyrics at you get ready to duck
I keep u going all day like a

And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard

Am going in like a tempan
Only difference is zer is no zero this is
My on gang of a psycho
I heard there was a Ohio rap
His name was milo

To my own freestyles yo

I give it to you fully
Like an open letter
Paper like a hater lighter
Than feather girl got finger
By some sharp nail
Always having a escape route
You can't fuck me in jail
Am always on the wrong
But i never fail, send my message to your state or mine to mine mail
And if he talk shit
I will collapse the holy grill
Could try try this is me Bye bye moutherfuckers
