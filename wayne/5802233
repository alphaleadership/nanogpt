4 ContributorsMiss My Dogs (Live) Lyrics
And man I miss the times
We would shine, you would keep on your side
You would teach me how to ride
And you would teach me how to pride
Then we'd get on the line and go over our lines
We were in the same position
And that's when you changed position, shit
I never changed and I miss ya, and it's strange
But I never forget ya
Though that ain't you with them bitches homie
And I know that ain't you wit that dissin on me, that's why I
Never replied and never will, just let em live phony
If ya ever died, I swear to God, I got yo kids homie
What's mine is theirs, I gotta give homie, and yea
We still a army in this bitch homie
Yeah Cash Money still the shit homie, shit, homie!
What's really real is you feelin me n*
That Hot Boy shit still in me n*, word to giggity n*
And I ain't got time to speak the history
I miss you and I know you missin me, Gizzle, but

Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin againYou might also likeEmbed
