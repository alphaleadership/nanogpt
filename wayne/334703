7 ContributorsLoyal Freestyle Lyrics
Just got rich
Being broke was a bitch
These niggas ain't loyal
Fuck it all the shit that he did!

These girls ain't got what I got
These girls can’t do what I do
These girls all fake and I know it
And you know you had a real in me
But shit OK
Take your money, I'mma go my way!
These niggas ain’t loyal
And that’s why it’s the song I sing

And it just got rich
Me and my girls finna take us a trip…..
One time for my niggas in the shit
Uh, these hoes ain’t got a thing on me
No, these bitches ain’t got nothing on me
Oh, but when I do what I do
Stunting me and my crew
I had your back when you were down and out
I was there and you know it’s true!
One time for my real niggas
Two times for ‘em fake hoes
What we had was so real
Oh, let it all go!
Go down the drain
Stuntin’ in my brand new thing
Hit the club with me and my girls
You wasn’t loyal you fucked her once and you’ll do it again
You might also like
These niggas ain’t loyal
But these bitches can’t do nothing for you
Oh, these niggas ain’t loyal
But these bitches can’t do nothing for you

Oh, not a rasta but I’m smoking waly
Said she wanna ride it like a harley (Ohh)
Here’s my number girl call me
So we can link up later make a movie
Girl, you know I want ya put that thing on me
Your body’s is calling
Uh girl, you want it!
(Sing it, Sean Kingston)
Imma hit it all night
Smoking on this Kush, I bout to take flight
(Sing my shit)
Me and my niggas stuntin’ in the building
Watch these lame niggas outside?

I wasn’t born last night
I know these hoes ain’t right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she ain’t have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that’s that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart when she’d rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch an inch when she’d rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I’m the shit, oh
Nigga, that’s that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything, but trust these hoes
These niggas ain’t loyal
And these niggas won't do nothing…
(tell them Sean Kingston man)
These hoes ain't loyal
And these niggas won't do nothing for em
Let them hoes go
These hoes ain’t loyal
And them bitches can’t do nothing for em
And them bitches can’t do nothing for em21Embed
