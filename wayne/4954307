4 ContributorsFrontin’ Lyrics
But i was just frontin
Cuz tha f. is for fuckin
Know im talkn bout
Haha this shit real
Based on a true story
Lauf at cha boy
Woke up in tha crib on a weekend morn
Seen like i feel asleep with tha tv on
106 and park - the early version tha rerun
Ykno im talkn bout
New joint of tha day just startin na play
It was this joint here so i turn that way
Becuz tha beat was bumpin
Na fa real this beat is bumpin
Ykno
So i wiped out tha cold out my eyes
And who did i see
My ex girlfriend on bet
Im like not again
Ah oh man not again
Cuz when she was with me
I was serious tho
Never knew she turned out ta be a video hoe
Im like man thats fucked up
Oh man thats fucked up
But every other city i go
I still see tha same silly hoe
Him in every other video
I still see tha same silly hoe
Ykno but i was just frontin
Hahaha i was just frontin...
...but i bring it back like crack
Like 88 stacks
Like 88 stacks in a crack house
Get right - maybe they say
That tha engagement may have changed him
But everybody still seem ta wanna be famous
And everybody still seems ta wanna be nameless
But bitch we happy and we shamless
Im anothers baby daddy
And my babys daddy
I used ta be a dawg til tha rays beams heavey
But i was just frontin
I was just frontin
Cuz tha f is for fuckin
And i was just frontin
Woke up in tha crib on a weekend morn
Seem like i feel asleep with tha tv on
106 and park - the early version tha rerun
Ykno im talkn bout
New joint of tha day just startin na play
It was this joint here so i turn that way
Becuz tha beat was bumpin
Na fa real this beat is bumpin
I wiped out tha cold out my eyes
And who did i see
My ex girlfriend on bet
Im like not again
Oh no she made it ta tha top ten again
Cuz when she was with me
I was serious tho
But i never knew she turned out ta be a video hoe
Im like man thats fucked up
But i was just frontin
Tha f is for fuckin
