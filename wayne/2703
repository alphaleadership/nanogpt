32 ContributorsStreets Is Watchin Lyrics
Yeah, uh-huh
David Banner on the beat, bitch
Hahaha
Young Money, Streets

I'm a east sider rider, whoa kimosabe
Bitches get to stepping like Cole, Gina, Tommy
Pussy is a weapon and my hoes think I'm Simon
And Simon say "go and get my motherfucking money"
Young Moolah bitch, tell them hoes, take their clothes off
And I don't hunt birds but I'll shoot you in your mohawk
Yeah, flow nasty like coleslaw
Call me Mr. No Flaw

Yeah, I sip drank and pop pills 'til I dose off
Wake up, grab the mic then I goes off
Too G for office, boss of all bosses
Crucify rappers, nail niggas to the crosses
I'm fresh out the slaughterhouse, blood on my apron
We Louisianimals, watch me let the gators in
I'm going on my paper run, a week at the Days Inn
Icing on my fingertips, I be getting cake in
You might also like
I—I be getting cake then
Watching for the rats and trying not to get snakebit
It's that pointing-at-your-face shit
And if you scared, you better go and see Mase, bitch
David Banner on the beat, ho
And I beat the beat up like Deebo
I—I—I got the game on TiVo
So I guess you can say: "The Streets Is Watchin'"

I don't promise much but I promise you that it'll flow boy
Name Jake but you can call me Millz-bury Dough Boy
Silence on the nine but the chopper make more noise
But if the bitch scream, I'ma pop her, no noise
Bank account type solid, truck nice and brolic
The rims sticking out like the shoulders on Dwight Howard
You niggas ain't G's, you're gents and quite coward
But I'll put you higher than flight pilots

I am petrifying, the metal turn to lightning
Burn through your clothes like an iron
I am no American Idol, no Simon Cowell
Wack niggas throw in the towel
I'm getting money with the rap, pay me by the vowel
I'm hungry like a pack of wolves so I just howl, holla
Cash rules everything around me
So I'ma get the money, dollar, dollar bills and them hundreds
I—I be getting cake then
Watching for the rats and trying not to get snakebit
It's that pointing-at-your-face shit
And if you scared, you better go and see Mase, bitch
David Banner on the beat, ho
And I beat the beat up like Deebo
I—I—I got the game on TiVo...

Ugh, yo, yo yo
I'm a bad, what—'bout to get a mani-ped'
I'm the big bad wolf and your granny dead
Even though I'm in Mexico
I rep New York like Plaxico
Look, switch my name, now I'm celebrating Hanukkah
Lewinsky, bitches, Young Money Monica
I been hot since Hedgehog—Sonic The
So could you pass me the keys to the Ton-i-ka?
I mean "Tonka"—that's the truck bitches
Fuck you and fuck all of you fuck bitches
Matter-fact, put some sprinkles on my cupcakes
And get ready to put your dimples in this duct tape

I—I be getting cake then
Watching for the rats and trying not to get snakebit
It's that pointing-at-your-face shit
And if you scared, you better go and see Mase, bitch
David Banner on the beat, ho
And I beat the beat up like Deebo
I—I—I got the game on TiVo
So—So I guess you can say: "The Streets Is Watchin'"1Embed
