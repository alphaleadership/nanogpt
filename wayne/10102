5 ContributorsWe Ain’t Stoppin’ Lyrics
Whoa, whoa
The Big Tymers, nigga
Who? Who?
The Big Tymers, nigga
Huh?
Get it right

Bentley interior, I lay back on it
Every time a nigga see me it's a Kodak moment
Now, I ain't the one to brag (Nope)
But I bought myself a Hummer, my brother a Jag (For sure)
I'm takin' all the hoes, and I'm makin' you mad (Yeah)
You violate my household, I'm bustin' your ass
Is you listenin'?
Do you see my ice when it's glistenin'?
Cause if you're with that baller blockin', niggas comin' up missin' then

I need a biznite to get right up in my new Prowler
And put her lips tight on this pipe to suck out the problems
Need a Rolex with princess cuts all at the bottom
Need a kit with twenty-inches on the car that I'm drivin'
Went from dimes to quakes, to money like Bill Gates
Doin' a-hundred on interstates
In Hummers on thirty-eight's
See, we are the CMB, my nigga
Fresh, Baby, Hot Boys, and Wheezy Whee, my nigga
What
You might also like
Wherever it's poppin', we stoppin'
But if it ain't hot then, we not then
Wherever it's twurkin', we workin'
She got to be slurpin', for certain

Project and hood rat bitch is who I like
A bitch that's 'bout ridin', and goin' on flights (What)
What
I met this bitch in Cabrini Green, a nasty ho
Liked that dick from the back
And you could, *cough*,​​ in her throat
A bitch that's 'bout hustlin' and smugglin' work
Head bustin' and thuggin' just like Turk
A wild bitch off Grape Street doin' her thing
Big ass, big tits, and she loved eatin' ding-a-ling
I need a black hoe (Black hoe), one with the braids in her head
Workin' with some ass that could give good head
Can't forget about this bitch up in Philly on Richard Allen
Freak-nasty bitch that's always swallowin'
Stickin' to the G-Code, Ree's, and Girbauds
Got hands and 'bout strappin', quick to beat a ho
Oops, almost forgot about Tasha up in the watts
A hot girl for sure that stayed droppin it like it's hot
Wherever it's poppin', we stoppin'
But if it ain't hot then, we not then
Wherever it's twurkin', we workin'
She got to be slurpin', for certain

Bitch, I'mma be stun'n until the day I go (What?)
Bentley's and Hummers, and drop Diablos (What?)
Runnin' with niggas that don't love no hoe (What?)
Platinum grill cause, bitch, I'm done with gold

Now, you know it's Lil Wheezy off the heezy, believe me, whoa
Hot like pepper, slidin' out the Kompressor slow
Me and your wife - slut, don't slam my door
Cut on the lights, look how the damn watch glow

Hold up, Wayne (What), you know what, Wayne? (Whoa)
I'mma get in this bitch and do donuts, man
Now wait, Bubba, you gon' make me go buy a Grape Hummer
And put my name in diamonds on the license plate, cousin
Now, peep me, slick
I got a ho out the project that eat the dick, she a freaky bitch
Nigga, you know it's Iceberg, boy, straight off the block
With the number-one stunna, and we blazin' hot, what
Wherever it's poppin', we stoppin'
But if it ain't hot then, we not then
Wherever it's twurkin', we workin'
She got to be slurpin', for certainEmbed
