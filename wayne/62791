36 ContributorsUptown Lyrics
Uh, yeah
Uh-uh
Uh, uh
Uh-uh

I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

A$AP, where my crew at
Swag so sick where the birds caught the flu at
All the hoes know me, don't need to ask, "Who that?"
Or where the heat at, my nigga, 'cause we do that
And pistol popping get it popping, niggas better move that
Cause we get a Glock and with the stock and he ain't scared to shoot it like
4 G's: blew that, G4: flew that
I'm the shit, you must admit, true that
Yeah I'm so uptown
Niggas know we get it for the low uptown
Uh gold, got 'dro, got snow uptown
Bitch-shit niggas scared to go uptown
Money making Manhattan, whip game proper
Them might be the product of the locker
A$AP, know I'm gonna prosper
Don’t care, cause I'm only straight as my posture
See A$AP Rocky LiveGet tickets as low as $312You might also like
I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

Boom, nigga, Nast in the house
Flow like a drug, pass it around
Fag, you're a doubt, what you rapping about?
A$AP nigga, trash on the couch
Glass to the mouth, Patrón in the system
Tool on the waist just in case I gotta fix 'em
Bullets like fiends just dying to hit them
Nigga did I mention, swag house nigga
Get slapped in your shit if you badmouth nigga
Left the Range in the garage and brought the Jag out, nigga
Nast be the shit that you brag about, nigga
I ain't even tryna hear about your hereabouts, nigga
Weird-ass nigga, scared-ass nigga
I'm done with this track, did you hear that, nigga? (What?)
(?) and I did wrap niggas
Try to step on my throne?
Bitch, this is my home

I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
I'm a uptown blood slime, balling's in my blood line
Pants sagging real low, I'm running from the one time
Free Church boy, yeah, my nigga caught a gun crime
Mobbing on Lenox and I'm grinding 'til the sunrise
I'm really getting dope, boy, free my nigga Dough boy
Catch me on Broadway, we got it for the low, boy
And I got flow, boy, in other words, hoes, boy
Body after body, yeah, you already know boy
I'm bumping "Oh Boy", classic Harlem shit
True Religion, who you kidding? Nigga started this
Young Twelv' get it gang, got the hardest shit
Polo down to the socks, looking marvelous
I'm from the home of the free S
I'm Grade on the West like I'm Gucci on the ES
Aura like GS, stepping out the GX
A$AP up, y'all niggas kill me with the BS... P.S.:

I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeahEmbed
