8 ContributorsRight One Lyrics
You got the right one (The right one)
Come from the trenches and I'm gettin’ close to a B (B)
Private or in public, bitch, don't come for me (At all)
Made my sacrifices to live comfortably (Feel me?)
Got no patience for you suckers, I stay sucker free
You got the right one (The right one)
I know some shooters, I hope they don't shoot again, shoot again
I was a hooper that hooped and hung out with hooligans, hooligans
And I’m still laced up by the greats, I changed the pace to win the race
Bust down the face, times is great (Uh)

One of a kind, they know I'm the nigga they recognize, a stepper (Big steppin')
I pull up to my hood, they treat me like I'm regular
Private plane, my Rollie plain, I don't do nothin' extra
All the tires on my foreigns bald like Uncle Fester
When I was a youngin', I seen all the cars, the good in the streets and all of the flaws
Niggas with money, the rise and the falls, sent to the yard or a one-way car
I was the chosen one, town shit, I'm the golden son
Next to my bed, keep a loaded gun
Frontline soldier, the boldest one
I say, "It’s in me, never on me baby" (Baby)
My partner’s like, "You goin'?" "Oh, you know me, baby" (Baby)
Eight figures at twenty-four like I’m Kobe, baby (Kobe, baby)
Ten M's, I built a mansion, bro, we goin' crazy
You might also like
You got the right one (The right one)
Come from the trenches and I'm gettin’ close to a B (B)
Private or in public, bitch, don't come for me (At all)
Made my sacrifices to live comfortably (Feel me?)
Got no patience for you suckers, I stay sucker free
You got the right one (You got the right one)
I know some shooters, I hope they don't shoot again, shoot again
I was a hooper that hooped and hung out with hooligans, hooligans
And I'm still laced up by the greats, I changed the pace to win the race
Bust down the face, times is great (Uh)

You got the right one, I'm 'bout to light one
Who got the soda? I'm 'bout to spike one
Bust down the gold one, bust down the white one
I got the plain one, I got the bright one
Ain't got no main one, ain't 'bout to wife one
Ain't gon' rename one, can't reunite one
I got a straight one, I got a dyke one
Bitch, if you ain't one, you act just like one
Nigga, it's Tunechi, I'm bigger than Gucci
They say they want beef, and they really want sushi
I pull some strings, just like acoustic
Bitch, I'm a king, just like the smoothie
Somebody stink, sorry, excuse me
That's just the weed, I'm smoking dookie
These niggas fraud, these niggas flukey
Say he a dog, he just Snoopy
All my cars dark skin, all my boys mark men
All my broads booty poke out, oh my God, shark fin
Super like Clark Kent
I'm gettin' close to a B, fuckin' right, arms-length
I'm one of them dudes that come from the zoo
We shoot up your shit when there's nothin' to do
She lovin' the crew, we fuck on your boo
I'm with some niggas, we're not finna lose
I got some niggas that stuck in the shoe
I got some niggas that stuck in the hood
We breakin' down signs, stuffin' the 'Wood
Playin' with M's, I knew that I would
I'm in this big body, I don't play it
They got the spot, booin' with the onions
You got some money for me, baby, run it
Ain't feedin' the family, and you ain't a hunnid
Fly out to London, I'm there for a week
Not in the suites, we in the streets
You ain't gon' slide if one of y'all die
You know how I'm movin' 'cause I'm in it deep
I dare you to leave, there's dirt on my cleats
And I got receipts, nigga
I dare you to leave, there's dirt on my cleats
And I got receipts, nigga
You ain't contributin' nothin' to this table, then you cannot eat with us
I'm luggin' this cadence, one in the barrel, and I go to sleep with her

You got the right one (The right one)
Come from the trenches and I'm gettin' close to a B (B)
Private or in public, bitch, don't come for me (At all)
Made my sacrifices to live comfortably (Feel me?)
Got no patience for you suckers, I stay sucker free
You got the right one (You got the right one)
I know some shooters, I hope they don't shoot again (Bop, bop), shoot again
I was a hooper that hooped and hung out with hooligans (Pop, pop), hooligans
And I'm still laced up by the greats, I changed the pace to win the race
Bust down the face, times is great3Embed
