Velvet

She know I need her, I couldn't leave her
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt
In my t-shirt, in, in my t-shirt (Oh yeah)
I'm a believer, this girl a keeper
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t-shirt
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t-shirt
In, in my t shirt, in, in my t shirt

Woah, there she go (Woah)

When I wake up in the morning, see you spread (On my sheets, sheets)
It's so many things that's going through my head (While you sleep, sleep)
If I touch you there, I bet you spread your legs (My lil' freak, freak)
Kill that, then I put you back to bed (RIP)
But hold up, when we done, know, that was good sex
But go hop in the shower and make me some breakfast
I want some French toast, with all of that extra cheese
Eggs, home fries, and a lil' bit of ketchup
And I want some turkey bacon too
A nigga hungry so make a plate for two
Then I smack on your booty, go blend me a smoothie
I swear I can't leave her, that's word to Lil Tunechi

She know I need her (Yeah), I couldn't leave her (Woah)
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt (The way she fuck me, then she walk around)
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt (The way she fuck me, then she walk around)
In my t-shirt (In my t shirt), in, in my t-shirt (In my t-shirt)
I'm a believer, this girl a keeper
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t-shirt
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t-shirt
In, in my t-shirt, in, in my t-shirt

I hit you when times is hard (Yeah)
'Cause you help my mind avoid (Yeah)
You take my mind abroad (Yeah)
Must be a sign from God (Yeah)
I gots to keep you close (Close)
He likes to give you rope (Damn)
He let you hang yourself (Damn)
I let you hang and smoke (Yeah)
I let you drank and smoke (Yeah)
We fuck, we talk, we joke
We get emotional, you cry
And I got a lump in my throat
Man, love is so dope
Girl, fuck that fuckboy
And you don't need no fuck toys
And you can make as much noise
And if you're down for it, I'm up for it
But it's something 'bout your fucking eyes
They can see through to my other side
And these other hoes, they make me cum
But you, you make me come alive
She know I need her (Yeah), I couldn't leave her (Woah)
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt (The way she fuck me, then she walk around)
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt (The way she fuck me, then she walk around)
In my t-shirt (In my t shirt), in, in my t-shirt (In my t-shirt)
I'm a believer, this girl a keeper
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t-shirt
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t-shirt
In, in my t-shirt, in, in my t-shirt
She know I need her (Yeah), I couldn't leave her (Woah)
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt
The ways she fuck me then she walk around in my t-shirt
In my t-shirt, in, in my t-shirt
I'm a believer, this girl a keeper
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t-shirt
The way she lay it down and walk around in my t-shirt
In, in my t-shirt, in, in my t-shirt

Got to bust and I'm cumming all on my t-shirt
T-shirt, my t-shirt
Got to bust and I'm cumming all on my t-shirt
T-shirt, my-t shirt6Embed
