1 ContributorJust Know Dat (Remix) Lyrics
I'm the Opa-locka
Do you know who I is?
Brisco

Just now, just no remix (Brisco)
Brisco creepin', Just know dat-dat what it is
Tell them haters they can have my benz
If you want me, you can get it, just know that
Just know whatever, I'm on that
Just know baby, I'm me
Opa-locka goon say cheese
I get money, money I get
Get like me, I got them hating on frizz
My swagger, so extra
Just sweat me, I let her
Just be what you are, she with it
So we ride all night til' the wheels fall of
She say I do, and I'm asking so flaw
Model to it, but I have my check though
On my shit, I go solo
I'm shining Poe Boy logo
Just know dat, I'm going loco
Psychotic, bipolar
Red prada to the polo
I don't want her just no-no more
In the hood, they tell me "Go, Brisco"
You might also like
Just know dat, Just know dat
Just know dat, Just know dat
Baby, just know dat
Just know that, Just know that
Just know that
I've been grindin all my life and waitin' for the shine
If you ain't about that money
Then you wasting up my time
Just know dat, Just know dat
Just know dat, Just know dat
Baby, just know dat
Just know dat, just know dat
Just know that

I've been serving all my life
Need a little to get me right
Always boppin' hot all night
I don't even flashing lights

Just know dat, I'm so right
My money right, I'ma drop me a sea speck
Straigh to the bottom, out from the goals
Police on the chevy, drop a bitch on four
All around the city with a black 4-4
Boy, you gotta act like a G4
When I pull around the corner, everybody get low
See them jump out the window when you give them a "whoa"
You don't want thief, not with me
Bend over, everyday I'm in the crisp black t
See me sitting at the police, cause I see them folks
Shut the block down, homeboy we gotta go
I've been serving all my life
Need a little to get me right
Always boppin' hot all night
I don't even flashing lights

Just know dat, Just know dat
Just know dat, Just know dat
Baby, just know dat
Just know that, Just know that
Just know that
I've been grindin all my life and waitin' for the shine
If you ain't about that money
Then you wasting up my time

I've been rhyming all my life and waiting for the time
Now when I shone, see the bentley bright
And it just make them lose they minds and just know dat
Cause I'm not a yes man like no-o
J without Jelly got Gram
No they did not, if you ain't got a rubber band
No, it ain't really wanna holla if the hoes don't wanna dance

Head to the nod, I can't be broke
I love black, yellow, green like O'Saint boat
I gotta be jamaican 'cause I got nine jaws
Now i'm fully loaded in case a nigga tryna rob
Nine different women and they all want your part
Now my second album called R.O.O.T.S
What the hell I got a coop, I got a coupe in the garage
Never met Ice Cube until I lost my louie star
Love the bargain, got on my coke jacket
Be like ten stacks, a waste of kodak
Diddy rubbing it in your face, waste of pro dat
AIn't nothing like Blackhead in the Maybach
Virgo is my sign-in, can't get out on mine
No, i ain't tripping if you got a hundred percent
LIke I could blow it all and press rewind
Just know dat, Just know dat
Just know dat, Just know dat
Baby, just know dat
Just know that, Just know that
Just know that
I've been grindin all my life and waitin' for the shine
If you ain't about that money
Then you wasting up my time

Ok, now I gotta go hard
Flow so sick, I just might ball
I need pepto, throw so hard
Shittin' on your boys, just a big shoutout
I bought like a dog, never mind the couch
Floss like a boss, two meals on the house
And the shit y'all bring, it's the cash outside
The whip y'all bought, I right that off
I right you small, you ain't got no cash
Never good in the hood, better show that pass
Oh yeah, my nigga Brisco on the c-more black
Tell em' trap that shap, real niggas gonna rap
Better yet, the back light just load out
I'm black man, black air max
OLX chevy with the rooftop rack
Bring that shit you call swag

Just know dat, Just know dat
Just know dat, Just know dat
Baby, just know dat
Just know that, Just know that
Just know that
I've been grindin all my life and waitin' for the shine
If you ain't about that money
Then you wasting up my time
Just know dat, Just know dat
Just know dat, Just know dat
Baby, just know dat
Just know that, Just know that
Just know that
I've been grindin all my life and waitin' for the shine
If you ain't about that money
Then you wasting up my time (Just know dat)Embed
