3 ContributorsAmazing Love Lyrics
Got me a caddy and a trunk full of luggage in december, december
If it go through trial I'll be missing every Christmas like forever, forever
Let's go!

Sometimes I feel like givin' up (No, No)
But she call and I can't stop from pickin' up the phone (But)

Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Oooh, oh, the love, the love, the love, the love
Oooh, you know, you know, you know

Feel like flowers in the morning aftеr very bad weather
Out my mind all thе time but the sign said take a new direction, direction
Let's go!

Sometimes I feel like givin' up (No, No)
Then she fall and I can't stop from pickin' up (Ooh)
Because
You might also like
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Oooh, oh, the love, the love, the love, the love
Oooh, you know, you know, you know
Uhhh, Mula baby, Mula baby

They say she bad for a nigga and I know it
But it seem like I can't keep my mind off her
And she a bad mothafucka' when she make that kitty purr
And that ass real soft like fur
Word, I'm trippin'
No suitcase no luggage
Goin' back in forth like Aaliyah I'm buggin'
Her good love got me runnin' back
But she give me head, make my eyes roll back
Gotta kick it like a bad habit
Yeah I'm addicted I'm her addict
Try to make a left turn, gotta go another route
But I make a U-turn now I'm back in front her house
Yeah, all my niggas say I'm crazy
I might be crazy but she's amazing
Yeah, all my niggas say I'm crazy
I might be crazy but she's amazing
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the loveEmbed
