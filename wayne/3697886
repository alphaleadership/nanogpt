6 ContributorsThe Question (Live) Lyrics
This next song one of my favorite to perform, it's called "The Question," alright
Um, uh
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Fuck I am
Sometimes I wonder


Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense
I'm askin', "What am I supposed to do?"
Done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit
I done flew around the whole world
First, I shook a million hands and I took a million pictures
I'm a hostage in my own world
You see, my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches
I got too much on my damn mind
If I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'ma cope
I think they underestimate the grind
Well, I do to bring this dough and I'm only twenty years old
Wonder why I sip this devil juice, 'cause it feel incredible
Problems, I got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Yeah, uh, said I've been blessed with much to be expected
You might also like
What am I doin' here?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Said, what am I doin' here?
Said, woah-oh, oh-oh oh-oh, what am I doin' here?
Said, hey-hey-hey, said, what am I doin' here?


I hope this feelin' lasts for fuckin' ever
I don't wanna come back down, let me stay above the ground
I hope I do what I was meant to do
'Cause I've been searchin' for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, "Who gon' touch me now?"
And do we ever get to know the truth?
'Cause everybody say they have it, but to me, it seems they lack it
Now I'm rollin' and I'm sippin' lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinkin' liquor and I'm smokin' weed
And you can never do too much if you won't ever do enough
Wonder why it's me instead of you, I'll be there to rescue you
Problems, you got several
Thank God that none of that medical
What I need yall to do is put two hands in the air, like this, you ready?
We gon' go slow, side to side, yo, let's go

Said, what am I doin' here?
Yeah, yeah, what am I doin' here?
Woah-oh, oh-oh-oh, what am I doin' here?
Said, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey, what am I doin' here?


And, one time, look, before we do this song right here
