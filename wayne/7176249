2 ContributorsPhase Lyrics
Yeah, A. Blackstone (Weezy, Weezy, Weezy, baby)
DK, yeah (DK)
It's another one, it's official
Southern girls, northern girls, East, West girls
We got bags packed with Novocaine, kneading dough
I got my homies outside saying "Girl, what you trippin' for?"
Homies outside saying "Girls, what you trippin' for?"

He know from the start he had me as one
I had no choice to touch him
He had that edge, the way he worked me
He had me open, I could tell he was trouble
My girls told me that he's not the one
Plus my mama don't trust him
When he touched mе, all the warnings, they just blew past mе
I know that he is trouble

Gotta find a way to get through this
This dude is killing me
Got me trapped up in the game
No, no way to free me
And I'm playing the fool 'cause I know he's no good
You might also like
T-T-That's why it's just a phase
That, that I'm goin' through
A shame (It's such a shame)
That, that he got me breaking all my rules
Got me tripping, don't know what to do
They say it's just a phase
That, that I'm goin' through
A shame (It's such a shame)
That, that he got me breaking all my rules
Got me tripping, don't know what to do
They, they say it's just a phase

Every time I think I got strength to leave
I pack my bags, (Tell my girl) "come get me"
He's on his knees (Please)
Makin' promises that he can't keep
And then I believe him (Believe that)
I thought I was stronger than I seem
A southern girl with southern dreams
But he could see
Thought he knew me, but I guess he didn't

Gotta find a way to get through this
This dude is killing me
Got me trapped up in the game
No, no way to free me
And I'm playing the fool 'cause I know he's no good (No good)
That's why it's just a phase
That, that I'm goin' through
A shame (It's such a shame)
That, that he got me breaking all my rules
Got me tripping, don't know what to do
They say it's just a phase
That, that I'm goin' through
A shame
That, that he got me breaking all my rules
Got me tripping, don't know what to do
They, they say it's just a phase

Uh-uh, I'ma lil bit more than that
Shawty I'm so hot I'ma make you bring your oven back
And I'm fly, call me Firebird Pontiac
Dark, rich, and strong like Cognac
What's your zodiac? See me I be a Libra
And I do everything twice so I eat her, eat her
I need her, need her, yeah it's Jacida's son
With a tongue like a 9 milimeter gun
And we don't need a gun, because we keep peace
Tylenol PM sex, now she sleep
Shh, see I just put her to bed, to bed, to bed
Now I'ma rock your body, turn you over
Smell me like some burnin' produce
In the mornin' turn you over, while you yawning bend you over
Feel like heaven, I know baby
See this just I know baby
See he can be your phase, but I know he can't phase me
 (DK, Danity Kane and Wayne)
 (Girl what you trippin' for?)
 it's just a phase
 (You can be a phase, you not phase me, that's right)
 (I see you , I see you Diddy, give 'em the )

It's just a phase (A phase)
That, that I'm goin' through
A shame (Oh, woah)
That, that he got me breaking all my rules
(He got me breaking all my rules)
Got me tripping, don't know what to do
(And I don't even know what to do)
They say it's just a phase
That, that I'm goin' through
A shame (Oh no)
That, that he got me breaking all my rules
Got me tripping, don't know what to do
They say it's just a phase

Danity Kane and Wayne
It's hot, South baby
D. Woods
See I-I-I be a bad boy with cash money
Bye
Young Money
Young Weezy, baby
