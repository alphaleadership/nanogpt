4 ContributorsGirl Donâ€™t Do That Lyrics
Young mulah, baby
It's Khao
Let's get it popping like

Girl, don't you do that
Pop it, don't shoot that
Made it out, dispute that
Sixty, Wheezy, you that

Ayy, ayy, lord have mercy
Look at that shawtie over there, she look realist
Who got more ass than these niggas could deal with
How on Earth do the jeans conceal that?
I gotta get a clearer view, she working in the mirror boo
Drop it to the floor, shake that body like Shakira do
Other women copy, I knew 'em 'cause you imitate them
Try to get a player right, jiggle with that cellulite
Shortie look surprised because I'm part of the who's who
Or maybe wanna choose you, a kinda girl I'm used to
Face like Nia Long, skin Tov Lo, yeah
Body like the 'licious, money like Oprah
Sammy LJ take me to your home now
Knock me up when we alone, make my black slave known
What really turned me on was a well known fact
That she only worked that nine to to, Khao on the track
Ayy

Girl, don't you do that
Pop it, don't shoot that (Yeah, yeah)
Made it out, dispute that (Dispute that)
Sixty, Wheezy made you that
Girl, don't you do that
Pop it, don't shoot that (Yeah, yeah)
Made it out, dispute that (Dispute that)
Sixty, Wheezy made you that

How about we tell you 'bout love
Shake it like it off
Turn around, back it up, now catch 'em all
Catch 'em all, now catch 'em all
Just pick your ass up, drop it, make that ass low

Little nigga but in that pussy, I stand tall
And tell your man I beat up niggas like park ball
You seen the color purple (Yeah) and we don't smoke that green
We smoke the color purple (Yeah), the color purple

Girl, don't you do that
Pop it, don't shoot that (Yeah, yeah)
Made it out, dispute that (Dispute that)
Sixty, Wheezy made you that
Girl, don't you do that
Pop it, don't shoot that (Yeah, yeah)
Made it out, dispute that (Dispute that)
Sixty, Wheezy made you that
How about we tell you 'bout love
Shake it like it off
Turn around, back it up, now catch 'em all
Catch 'em all, now catch 'em all
Just pick your ass up, drop it, make that ass low

I'm a pimp up on the drive by
Pimp it to my spine
And let me introduce you to some bitches that I got
I got to hold a lot of hustle
She kind of love fucking, she don't use the pussy muscle
Make your body do the shuffle
Got a bitch named Jaz, she let my Stacy dash
She be raking in the cash, take it in the ass
Janet and Janine, now take it in the jaw
Nobody like to fuck 'em 'cause they like to take the balls
And it's blowjob Kate, her head game's great
Her tongue run on me, like the bitch vibrate
And they all have in common, it's a well known fact
But they only pop they pussy to a Khao track

Girl, don't you do that
Pop it, don't shoot that (Yeah, yeah)
Made it out, dispute that (Dispute that)
Sixty, Wheezy made you that
Girl, don't you do that
Pop it, don't shoot that (Yeah, yeah)
Made it out, dispute that (Dispute that)
Sixty, Wheezy made you that
How about we tell you 'bout love
Shake it like it off
Turn around, back it up, now catch 'em all
Catch 'em all, now catch 'em all
Just pick your ass up, drop it, make that ass lowEmbed
