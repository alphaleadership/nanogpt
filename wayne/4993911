10 ContributorsAin’t My Fault Lyrics
J. White, I need a beat I can go off on
Go'n with your hatin' ass
Dusty ass ho
Rat lookin' ass ho

It ain't my fault these bitches mad though (It ain't my fault)
It ain't my fault that's where the cash go (It ain't my fault)
Get out your feelings, get a bag, ho (It ain't my fault)
Walked in Givenchy, clear the tab, ho (It ain't my fault)
I bought the Bentley just to shit on all these bitches (It ain't my fault)
I bought the Wraith just to give it to my nigga (It ain't my fault)
I came from nothin', I finally made it to the millions (It ain't my fault)
Stack them racks up to the ceilin', yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (It ain't my)

It ain't my fault your ho wan' fuck 'round with a real one, yeah, yeah (She want a real one)
Now she hate lames, she tried me out, she know the difference, yeah, yeah
My boy was Jordan, he passed her 'round, I'm Scottie Pippen, yeah, yeah
No MTV, but she wan' see just how I'm livin', yeah, yeah
Nigga, mind your business, yeah, won't tell you 'bout who I'm hittin', yeah, yeah
Just had a son, yeah, put the other one on her titty, yeah, yeah
Two-step like Diddy, yeah, got a project bitch, saddity, yeah, yeah
She know I get it, yeah, get  her bought with Hello Kitty, yeah, yeah
Murder be the cost, so death to snitches, yeah, yeah (Death to snitches)
She came with it so I kept them digits, yeah (Kept the line)
Relationship, you got one, told y'all dig it, yeah
That ain't the cause, see, I murdered your broad, it ain't no limit (Hah)

It ain't my motherfuckin' fault that my wrist talk even in the pitch dark
South Baton Rouge, it ain't my fault that I stick talk
Niggas mad I'm on, but I get my hustle off the Clicquot
Blame it on the blues why I'm always in a bitch mouth
Bentley truck, what the fuck? It ain't my fault
I'm a street nigga, these niggas be tellin' my name, insultin' my game
Pillow talkin' to a bitch who I fucked on the first night, nigga (It ain't my fault)
That your money ain't right, nigga (It ain't my fault)
You don't smoke how we smoke, nigga (It ain't my fault)
You don't drink how we drink, nigga (It ain't my fault)
You ain't real like we real, nigga, it ain't my fault
You don't kill how we kill, nigga, it ain't my fault

It ain't my fault these bitches mad though (It ain't my fault)
It ain't my fault that's where the cash go (It ain't my fault)
Get out your feelings, get a bag, ho (It ain't my fault)
Walked in Givenchy, clear the tab, ho (It ain't my fault)
I bought the Bentley just to shit on all these bitches (It ain't my fault)
I bought the Wraith just to give it to my nigga (It ain't my fault)
I came from nothin', I finally made it to the millions (It ain't my fault)
Stack them racks up to the ceilin'Embed
