Hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hard (Hard)
Hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hard (Okay, hard)
Hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hard (It's the good, hard)
Closed mouths don’t get fed on this boulevard

Okay, I’m booked out until August
Show money deposits
See the shit then I cop it
Got but a house note in my pocket
I’m on South Beach with the top off
Bad bitch and her ass soft
Something outta that catalog
She introduced to that lockjaw
And I think her name was Lisa
Or maybe it was Sheila
My chevy sittin’ too high
I call that Wiz Khalifa (Ahh)
And I’m all about the new Franklins (franklins)
Ain't talkin’ Aretha
Bitch my league too major
I’m hip-hop Derek Jeter (woo)
And I’m still feeling my pockets
Big bass and it's knocking
Yeah this be the remix
But still ride around with that rocket
I’ll go walking back to my household
“We The Best” be the logo
Hundred grand for that neck glow
All about the dinero
Nigga flow so retarded

Ok, now, black card in my pocket
Riding round in that gatti
Pistol off my boxers
I ain't got time to be boxing
Got a red bone she look tropic
If she fuck me right then she shopping
Young money we poppin’

See that V-neck, that's Polo
Grilled up like Ocho

You niggas chicken: pollo
Nigga LIV on Sundays, King of Diamonds Monday
Swagger just dumb, call it Kelly Bundy
Got a big house with a backyard, fish tank with sharks in it
Real nigga, I’m authentic
I’ll fuck the bitch 'til she short-winded
Got a bad bitch who be bartending
Couple homies that gang bang
I get on anybody track and hit that bitch with that Wayne train
Free my nigga T.I
SooWoo to the beehive
Got a G6 and a G5
You pussy niggas you feline
Don’t stop the party, we be getting gnarley
Woah kimosabe, I’m with Mack, Fuccus, and Marley

Out here tryna get it, each and every way
Mama need a house, baby need some shoes
They want that Carter IV, bitch, it’s coming soon
Same old shit (Shit), just a different day (Day)
