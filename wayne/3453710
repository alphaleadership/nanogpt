70 ContributorsHell Rain Lyrics
Yeah, oh
Oh, woah
Ayy, yeah
Hey

It seems like I've been screwing up
Everything I touch gets to ruining
My homies call it growing pains
I'm trying not to go insane
Rain falls down
Staring at my window
You know when it rains, it pours
I can't even lie no more
Tears fallin' down on my window
Rain falls down

Yeah, rain, rain, rain feel like heat on my skin, yeah (On my skin, yeah)
We some born losers, but baby girl, I'ma win, yeah (I'ma win, yeah)
I believe in God, but this lifestyle I live, I sin, yeah (I sin, yeah)
Ayy, I'm a Hellboy, fuck a nine to five, I'm all in, yeah (I'm all in, yeah)
Now I'm stuck lookin' at hell rain through my window
Look like fireflies outside my damn window
Got my third eye open, see the world through my window
Got a big Draco on me, pussy boy, I let it go
Bitch, you getting smoked, blowin' on hella dope
On some good smoke, murder what she fuckin' wrote
Yeah, I took her soul, pussy boy, she made a hole
Now she give me the throat, hope lil' baby don't choke
I love Trippie Redd
See Trippie Redd LiveGet tickets as low as $37You might also like
Second star to the right, Escobar, Dolomite
Repertoire, frozen ice, pepper, salt, fork, and knife
Spoonin' with a nigga wife, ruin any bitch's life
Doin' shit to give me life, throwing dick like a strike
Pink Vans, white shirt, uh, pink Xans, white Percs, uh
Pink sands, white dirt, uh, mink pants, nice fur, yeah
Think fast, not first, uh, hard times, light work, yeah
Heavy heart might jerk, uh, cold-hearted, iceberg, uh
Paul Wall slow-mo, uh, sip a four, need four more, uh
Smoke up all the weed in 24, I'm a poor, poor, poor soul
More and more rain flows, black Rolls, just cruise
No umbrella, no coat, I'm stuck, she's cold, yeah

It just seems like I've been screwing up
Everything I touch gets to ruining
My homies call it growing pains
I'm trying not to go insane
Rain falls down
Staring at my window
You know when it rains, it pours
I can't even lie no more
Tears fallin' down on my window
Rain falls down
Rain falls down
Rain falls down
Rain falls down
Rain falls down6Embed
