27 ContributorsStay Hood Lyrics
Uh (Bow)
See, y'all niggas don't know
(Ay, no, we hear this shit, just let that shit go)
See, I'm flowin', right, man? I like the flows to rock, man
(Turn the fuck up, man)
Arrogant-ass motherfucker
(You know that I set shit off)
I'll fuck it up
Can't tell me shit (Waka Flocka)

See, I'ma stay hood 'til the day that I die
Yeah
'Til the day that I die
I'ma twist this weed, my nigga, let's get high
Yeah
I said I'ma stay motherfucking hood 'til the day that I die
Phantom Ghost, no rims, nigga, that's just how I ride
I come from the hood where you don't testify
Take murder with no tears off in your fucking eyes

All my niggas ride where I come from
Ain't no fair ones, nigga, fuck you thinking?
Have a fuck boy Pacquiao planking (Sleepin')
'Til the loud got plain, too, drinking (Gas)
50K for a show, no popping (Flex)
Spit izzle to a dumb bitch ears (Okay)
Broke niggas can't talk like this (No)
Rolex on my main bitch wrist (Flex)
Blood bottoms on a young nigga boots (Br-r-rap)
Looks like I just stomped a nigga out (Pussy)
Get your man down, nigga, lights out
(Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow)
Shoot at your ass, what that mouthing about? (What?)
He ain't tough no more, what's happening? (Happenin'?)
Outside your mama house, what's brackin'? (What's happenin'?)
Popping mollies like Tylenols and Aspirin
Geeked up, pulled up, hyena laughin' (Hahaha, Flocka)
Them boys ain't real, stop acting like us
In the squad, I bust, get cheese like crust
I'm the only motherfucker that I really trust
In a bad bitch's guts â€“ always
Counting money like always
Getting money from three ways
I could never, ever see no rainy days
See Waka Flocka Flame LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also like

Yeah
'Til the day that I die
I'ma twist this weed, my nigga, let's get high
Yeah
I said I'ma stay motherfucking hood 'til the day that I die
Phantom Ghost, no rims, nigga, that's just how I ride
I come from the hood where you don't testify
Take murder with no tears off in your fucking eyes

Hollygrove in this motherfucker
I'm tired of all these bitch niggas
These motherfuckers like Robitussin
I'm rolling up with my bitch, nigga
As a matter of fact, she roll it for me
Swisher Sweets, swish, nigga
Hit that shit like an open jumper
Rest in peace Li'l Beezy
I wish my nigga could see me now
Motherfuckers better king me
I'ma walk around wearing Jesus' crown
These niggas just pussy
I'ma let that chopper eat 'em out
Dead body in the bushes
Well, that's the bush you don't beat around
Beat your ass with my skateboard
Weed loud like it make noise
I'm on them trees like acorns
My cellphone going napalm
Guns sound like bass drums
Young Money drum section
Psycho ward, nigga. 1-7, Tunechi
See, I'ma stay hood 'til the day that I die
Yeah
'Til the day that I die
I'ma twist this weed, my nigga, let's get high
Yeah
I said I'ma stay motherfucking hood 'til the day that I die
Phantom Ghost, no rims, nigga, that's just how I ride
I come from the hood where you don't testify
Take murder with no tears off in your fucking eyes6Embed
