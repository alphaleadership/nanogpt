1 ContributorOut Here Grindin’ (Mega Mix) Lyrics
DJ Khaled, We The Best season has returned!
Cause I'm out here grindin
I do this for the streets, The Runners!
Cause I'm out here grindin, hey, hey

I don't care what nobody say (Say) I'ma be me (Be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (Cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nothin with nobody
Homie, I gotta get me mе (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slеpt in eight days, I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nothin to me cause I am the streets

Put my life on the line, but I'm likely to grind
I'm on top of the game, fuck if you like it or not
That's how I get the freaks, strawberry Swisher Sweets
You'll be dealin with H, when you dealin with G's
Now she deal with the realest, shoppin like it's still December
Diplomat on the fender of the Phantom, I'm the winner (winner)
I do it for the hood (hood) I do it cause you cain't (cain't)
You suckers wish you could, Ricky Ross is in the bank
You might also like
Hey Feds, heard you're bringin my name up
Know you want me bad, think I give a fuck? (Think I give a fuck?)
Better indict me now 'fore my price go up
Came in the world thuggin, leavin with big nuts
Yeah I run with killers homie, so what?
What you want me to tell you, I sold a lil dust?
Send your informant, I bet he leave bust
I ain't scared to go, I believe in Jesus

I don't care what nobody say (Say) I'ma be me (Be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (Cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nothin with nobody
Homie, I gotta get me me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days, I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nothin to me cause I am the streets

Look, W-E T-H-E B-E-S-T
DJ Khaled (We The Best!)
W-E T-H-E B-E-S-T
(DJ Khaled) That's me, ayy!
W-E T-H-E B-E-S-T
DJ Khaled (We The Best!)
W-E T-H-E B-E-S-T
(DJ Khaled) That's me, ayy!
I wake up to get my cake up, I'm out here grindin' (I'm out here grindin')
What can I say? I'm a product of my environment
Uh-oh, I'm in the game, watch me do me
Kicking these niggas, Khaled, man, call that Bruce Lee
Summer, winter, spring, I can't forget the fall
I still remain a dog, a diabetic and all
All I want is my paper, I don't care what they said
They stick they tongue out when they bow they head
'Cause we the best

I don't care what nobody say (Say) I'ma be me (Be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (Cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nothin with nobody
Homie, I gotta get me me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days, I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nothin to me cause I am the streets

Ayy, knock-knock, yeah, I'm knockin on the bank door
With a million dollars and I'm dropping off the cash flow
See, you ain't heard? I hit a lick, now my money right
Spend it on the U-Haul, dippin on the turnpike
Call up my dawgs (Dawgs), rag on my face (Face)
Bodies gon' fall (Fall), tell 'em it's Ace (Ace)
If I catch a charge, nigga, I'ma flee the state
Hit my niggas L.A. Reid and Khaled, watch me beat the case
You niggas flies—before, you was just maggots (Maggots)
I'm the shit bitch, because I'm black flaggin (Black flag)
Yessir, the DR's, the new squad
You niggas Mod Squad, we go hard
They like, "Oh God, there go T-Double
He got his clique and his brothers, I know it's gon' be trouble"
Knock boys on the black Jags
See 'em in them black masks
No, they can't stand my Black ass

Hahahaha, and we are the best
And Weezy be the shh like two H's after S
I got these niggas on shh like I gon deaf
And I'm right right, and your wrong left
Hahahah, check out this bizarre
I am regularly irregular
Khaled best DJ, Weezy best rapper
If Khaled say it's a movie, then Weezy best actor

I don't care what nobody say (Say) I'ma be me (Be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (Cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nothin with nobody
Homie, I gotta get me me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days, I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nothin to me cause I am the streets

I seldom got hated but it's typical now
But like a gumball, I'm sticking around
I'm getting it now, lyrics by the pound
If money really talks, my figures is loud
I'm making an entrance, fashionably late
Blew out the candles, made a wish, and then bit in the cake
I've been making what they, couldn't make if they payed
Meter write it for them, fuck it, I'll ship 'em a 
Ghost write for racks, I'll ghost write your tracks
I'll keep it on the hush, I bet you coming back
Snow White kickback relax, nah baby never that
The album coming soon, this mixtape just a jab
I got 'em thinking fast, but still react slow
It's me to blame, don't go crazy it's irrational
I'm out here grinding hard, so bitch keep up
There's only one reaction when I rap: "Jesus!"

I don't care what nobody say (Say) I'ma be me (Be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (Cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nothin with nobody
Homie, I gotta get me me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days, I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nothin to me cause I am the streets

Look, W-E T-H-E B-E-S-T
DJ Khaled (We The Best!)

A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-fucking P
Look, what the fuck do I care if Boosie can spell?
Ask me about it, I think he bootsie as hell
This the Product movement, and look we moving it well
The checks come to me, um, the proof in the mail
I'm the future of this, Hip Hop is mine
These rappers getting old and look me, I got the time
If y'all have a new rappers roster, you ought to write
Me in it 'cause now I'm here
It gotta be modified
Ha ha, I'm
Something like
A helicopter  so fly the chopper right
So ahead of my time, even the  surprised
'Cause I just ripped Boosie work, and I forgot to try

I'm a go-getter, entrepreneur, motherfuckin' hustler
If you wanna come and  there's a potential customer
If you ain't talk about green or cha-ching, nigga I won't fuck wit ya
Children in this game, and I'm the , you still can't touch me bruh
On another level, need a ladder just to step up
Even if your name was , you couldn't catch up
My game is getting stronger, always striving to get better
I'm a master of my craft, that's why I'm always getting cheddar
'Bout my dollars so it makes sense that I stay at 
But the way my verse can  pay attention to these beats
Out here grinding' in the West but flipping chips up in the East
I'm the H- makin' money everyday, you call me B-I-Z
And in case you can't spell, that means I'm the business
Bitch I spit laxative flows because I am the shit
Best believe it, that I'm never leaving' yo
I'm blessing these streets like 

I don't care what nobody say (Say) I'ma be me (Be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (Cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nothin with nobody
Homie, I gotta get me me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days, I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nothin to me cause I am the streetsEmbed
