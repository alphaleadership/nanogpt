3 ContributorsHolla, Holla Lyrics
Whoa, this is the Sqad
Bases loaded

Peanut flizzin' ya know
Keep drugs, pistols, and coke
Ain't no love for a bitch or a hoe
I'm not richer than most
Cause dog i ain't got shit but the flow
So don't think you can't get slugz sent to ya throat
Nigga I been tryin' to get in the door
So I be gettin' the dough
Catch me gettin' bent at the stove
Dog, i'm Mazant if u didn't know
We bring chickens cross the road
And that ain't no joke

Dirty, I'm Dizzy
Bitch, ain't no mo'
Rich in parts
So I can't go broke
Can't no flo'
Ain't no flo'
My name on Yo
I ain't no hoe
Get ya man
Fo' I paint ya flo'
You stupid if you think the sqad ain't gone flow
Gotta keep holdin' my jeans cause they hang so low
Yall might think yall
But ain't gone know
Until I cock back and pull at Yo
And let go
You might also like
Y'all gone hate me / cause I got my own shit
Y'all gone make me / Run and get my chrome shit
S-Q-A-D till the day I'm gone bitch
You ain't Sqad up
You can holla, holla, holla, holla
Y'all gone hate me / cause I got my own shit
Y'all gone make me / Run and get my chrome shit
S-Q-A-D till the day I'm gone bitch
You ain't Sqad up
You can holla, holla, holla, holla

Yeezy baby
Recognize game
You check ya hoe phone u might see the same name
And if u see dust
Thatz me switchin' lanes
And if you look hard
You can see me gettin' brain
And if u see a Bentley
That might be my brother Wayne

I'm Lil Weezy
Fo' sheezy
I'm off the heezy
Believe me
Peep me
I take this pimp shit deeply
Done seen to many pretty hoes suck me
To let a ugly to hoe eat me

He be J-Gudda
Jive fuckaz
Stay away from a young Sqad upper
Move inside for the mob
Cause the Sqad comin'
I'm probably thuggin'
In the eyes of the public
Wit slanted eyes on the buggy
And damnit I will ride or die for it
I'm front line
U try and front
And u will die tryin'
U see the front shine fine
Recognize I'm young money until the end of my time

Time up

Y'all gone hate me / cause I got my own shit
Y'all gone make me / Run and get my chrome shit
S-Q-A-D till the day I'm gone bitch
You ain't Sqad up
You can holla, holla, holla, holla
Y'all gone hate me / cause I got my own shit
Y'all gone make me / Run and get my chrome shit
S-Q-A-D till the day I'm gone bitch
You ain't Sqad up
You can holla, holla, holla, holla
It's young j
Put the k to ya face

Young yo in the coupe
And i beg u to race

Gudda be in somethin' wide
Wit some monster feet

Yo be in somethin' fine
And she swallowin' me

And I like to puff dro

And that vodka talk to me

And I like to pop pistols

And I like to pop pussy

Look I ride strapped up

And I strap up and let her ride

No matter what we do
We so Sqad

Now it's peanut man

My man dizzy be the man

In jeeps and vans

Gettin' brain til' a bitch get the hiccups (damn)

I been in that water
Tryin' to get my feet on land

So we gone stand

No discriminating
Baby we fuck fans

Leave the pussy bent like beat up can

Too gangsta
U won't see us dance

From that dirty
But I'm a clean up man

Boy, I hold ya life in Jesus hands

Y'all gone hate me / cause I got my own shit
Y'all gone make me / Run and get my chrome shit
S-Q-A-D till the day I'm gone bitch
You ain't Sqad up
You can holla, holla, holla, holla
Y'all gone hate me / cause I got my own shit
Y'all gone make me / Run and get my chrome shit
S-Q-A-D till the day I'm gone bitch
You ain't Sqad up
You can holla, holla, holla, hollaEmbed
