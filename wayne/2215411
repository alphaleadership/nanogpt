(I have to put the smackdown)
I have put the smackdown (I have to put the smackdown)
I have put the smackdown (I have to put the smackdown)
Smackdown is like when you give it to her real good
Smackdown is like when you give it to her real good
She like this is so good what am I doin'
She like this is so good what am I doin'

Call me  when I'am cruel, call me 
Weezy will fuck you to death
Shhh... can't here me now
Got your panties to the ground
When your man is outta town
I'm a mother fucker ain't I
Girl you know you can't like
That's why I got you walkin crooked like insane eye
And she say her boyfriend is like watchin paint dry
So I let her get on my dick and make her do the macarina
I make her touch her toes
I'm flyin this like crows
Right now I'm Lil Wayne but I'm a jangin on my clothes
And yes I eat pussy as long as she dushy
And I put the smackdown and he could'nt
Holla that girl (Smackdown)

When I call that ass just come thru but you don't wanna leave now do you? (I have to put the smackdown)
From the coop the G how we flew when you love how young and rich do you (I have to put the smackdown)
Your body and mind so confused but you don't wanna leave now do you? (I have to put the smackdown)
Said there's room and you know that it's true but you don't wanna leave now do you? (I have to put the smackdown)
I have put the smackdown (I have to put the smackdown)
I have put the smackdown (I have to put the smackdown)

When I call that ass just come thru but you don't wanna leave now do you? (I have to put the smackdown)
From the coop the G how we flew when you love how young and rich do you (I have to put the smackdown)
Your body and mind so confused but you don't wanna leave now do you? (I have to put the smackdown)
Said there's room and you know that it's true but you don't wanna leave now do you? (I have to put the smackdown)
I have put the smackdown (I have to put the smackdown)
I have put the smackdown (I have to put the smackdown)Embed
