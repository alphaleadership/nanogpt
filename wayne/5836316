Yeah, now shake that money-maker (Money)
Don't let that money make ya
You know I come to date you, and I'll accommodate ya
I'll make you cum, I ate you, I know your home lately
I turn your curly hair into that bone straightener
I make you moan, baby (Moan)
It feel right, don't it? I know I'm wrong, baby (Wrong)
That pheromone fragrance, can't miss no car payments (No)
I kiss her earlobe, like, "What you doin' later?" ("What you doin'?")
The Birkin alligator, them lames agitate her
I'm talkin' natural beauty, no make-up applicator (No need)
She say I killed the pussy (Kill it), I seen the affidavit
She blew my cap off (Blew it) like I had graduated (Tell 'em)
The roof decapitated, the booth contaminated (Damn)
Ayy, check my face card, I bet it's laminated (True)
My jewelry carbonated, my yard a hundred acres (A hunnid)
I'd like to nominate you to roll my dice in Vegas

Don't let that money make ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, shake your money-maker (Yeah)

Bitch, make it clap, blapp-blapp-blapp-blapp
Work that ass back, back-back-back-back
And now that ass fat, it used to be flat
What happened to that? Then she made it blatt
She say, "How it feel?" I say, "It feel like facts"
Then she start twerkin' (Yeah), this life a circus
You can ask Barnum, you can ask Bailey (Woah)
We don't need love, we just need favors
Put that on repeat and don't change the station (Woah)
Daddy ain't cheap, and mama ain't basic
And mama agree that daddy the greatest
And all I could see is ass-ass, ass-ass-ass, I'm in the matrix
This dick a tummy acher (Yeah), this dick a jumper cable (Uh)
Girl, let my tongue invade you, then let that cum escape you (Yeah)
Shake that money-maker, shake it lemon pepper
Like a salt shaker, give me high blood pressure, yeah (Woah)
Now shake your money-maker (Shake that money-maker)
Don't let that money make ya (Don't let that money make ya)
Now shake that money-maker (Now shake that money-maker)
Don't let the money make ya (Don't let that money make ya)
Oh, shake your money-maker (Shake your money-maker)
Shoutout to all the HBCUs out there
Don't let that money make ya (Don't let that money)
Oh, shake your money-maker (Shake that money)
Don't let that money make ya, baby (Don't let that money)
