59 ContributorsGood Day Lyrics
L-L-L-League of Starz
I ain’t had to kill nobody
I ain’t had to kill nobody
Today was a good day
I ain’t had to kill nobody
I ain’t had to kill nobody
I ain’t had to kill nobody (Ah!)

T-Raww killer, that nigga, cap peeler
One hitter, only hit bad bitches, that’s thriller, hah
King Hakim, YM, Last King
Nigga sending out shots, I'ma need a Jordan ring
Fuck you mean bitch? This really me, Gotti after life
Future looking bright, bitches crack tongue on the pipe
I don’t wanna see you twerk, we about that fuck life
Got a Asian ho, pussy go deep, Jerry Rice
I’m a dope nigga, give her D, dope dealer
Don’t play with a grave digger, that’s RZA
Ask my bitch, she tell you "Ain’t no nigga
Like the one I got", dick game gorilla
Bag in my bag like a Philly nigga clip
Came extended grip, armor’s with the Ruger, easy ruthless
Nigga with a attitude, my enemies is two shits
Don’t give two shits but you gon make a nigga pull it, but shit
See Tyga LiveGet tickets as low as $44You might also like
Today was a good day
I ain’t had to kill nobody
I ain’t had to kill nobody
Shoot you in your memory bank, memorize it
Uh, today was a good day
Cause I ain’t had to kill nobody
No, I ain’t had to kill nobody
But I'll shoot you in your memory bank, memorize it

Duct tape, duct tape, cover his mouth with duct tape
Check a nigga like a motherfuckin' update
Where the safe, nigga? Point to it
I catch a case, I wanna know who threw it
And my name, bitches speak fluent, I keep the Feds busy
I got the bread, never fed pigeons
Even though I get pissed off, I shit on y'all
We gon sip champagne out your skull
I can’t stand these niggas, I’m bout to fall
Got my girl the shoes with the spikes, volleyball
Fuck with Hollygrove, it’s gon be a holocaust
Hoes see me shinin, now they actin like a moth
YMCM-Bizzy, why I'm always busy
I done got too big headed for the crown to fit me
But I got my niggas with me and we got our skateboards
TTYL, Thank Thank You Lord, amen, cause uh
Today was a good day
I ain’t had to kill nobody
I ain’t had to kill nobody
But I'll shoot you in your memory bank, memorize it
Shoot you in your memory bank, memorize it
Shoot you in your memory bank, memorize it
But uh, today was a good day (Uh)
I ain't had to kill nobody, uhh

My dawg hit me yesterday, got fifteen keys
And he gon' let 'em all go for fifteen Gs
She said she want a Birkin, I look up like "Bitch please"
And I show that ho a brick like "You ain’t tryna flip these?"
Yeah I’m back, nigga, sellin' all these bricks
And if my homies sell you one, you bet not tell nobody shit
I said I’m back, nigga, rockin all these jewels
And I be ridin through my hood like I ain’t got nothing to lose
Shit, you thinkin' 'cause I rap I won’t go buy them bricks?
Give em to my dawg and let him do all kind of shit
Like take a point out, then put a point in
I fuck your main ho and all my homies joined in, shit
I’m getting money, must be the 'luminati
They think I signed up cause I just bought a new Ferrari
But they said they want my mind, soul and my body
And I looked at that nigga crazy and then I shot him, bow!
Today was a good day
I ain’t had to kill nobody
I ain’t had to kill nobody
But I'll shoot you in your memory bank, memorize it
Shoot you in your memory bank, memorize it
Shoot you in your memory bank, memorize it
But uh, today was a good day
I ain't had to kill nobody, uhh
