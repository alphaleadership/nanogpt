Mic check
Turn me up in my headphones
I can't hear myself at all
Yeah

And this is a real nigga anthem
This is a real nigga's standards
I am like one of the last ones
'Cause most of the real niggas passing
And most of the real niggas laughing
'Cause most of you lil niggas dancing
Most of my lil niggas jacking
Ain't too many real niggas rapping
I am like one of the last ones
Most of these lil niggas acting
Well you tell them niggas I said "Action"
See most of you lil niggas trappin'
Most of the real niggas traffic
See this is a real nigga's standards
This is a real nigga anthem

Most of the real niggas vanished
Now all of you lil niggas stranded
And most of you lil niggas panic
And all of the real niggas dandy
All of you lil niggas candy
All of you lil niggas Bambi
And all of my lil niggas bandits
Take all of you lil niggas' candy
All my bitches enchanted
They got fannies and never wear panties
See all of your bitches is nannies
They wear panties that look like their grannies'
Most of my bitches speak Spanish
They be tanning and cook when I'm famished
Your bitches got bad understanding
She can't even make you a sandwich
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is packing
So if one of you lil niggas yacking
All of my niggas attacking
See most of the real niggas absent
'Cause most come out jail and go back in
Me, I'm a walking attraction
And 'cause I'm like one of the last ones
Ayy, yeah
You might also like
And this is a real nigga anthem
This is a real nigga's standards
I am like one of the last ones
'Cause most of the real niggas passing
And most of the real niggas laughing
'Cause most of you lil niggas dancing
Most of my lil niggas jacking
Ain't too many real niggas rapping
I am like one of the last ones
Most of these lil niggas acting
Well you tell them niggas I said "Action"
See most of you lil niggas trappin'
Most of the real niggas traffic
See this is a real nigga's standards
This is a real nigga anthem

Bricks on deck, sticks on deck
Need a fix
Fix on deck, fix on deck
Hitting licks
Licks for check, yeah licks for check
Take a risk for a check
As long as it's for a check
Real niggas standard
Damn, the boy done took me off the corner
And put me in position forever better, forever loyal
Took this traffic 'cross the border, still sipping muddy waters
And ain't shit changed, it's like my conversation starter
Damn right that  mixing good with kush aroma
Ain't got no 9 to 5, we slang that work with no diploma
Had walked inside spot, they treat me like I'm the one that own it
This bad yellow ting, yeah she resemble 
Spend a week of in Manhattan, never scamming, no advancements
No one's bragging, it's deeper than rabbit
And this music just my passion
Then I fly in the sky Miami just to change the scenery
 and Tunchi-Lee
Respect the game of Big Man Ting

Ain't too many real niggas rapping
I am like one of the last ones
Most of these lil niggas acting
Well you tell them niggas I said "Action"
See most of you lil niggas trappin'
Most of the real niggas traffic
See this is a real nigga's standards
This is a real nigga anthem
Bricks on deck, sticks on deck
Need a fix
Fix on deck, fix on deck
Hitting licks
Licks for check, yeah licks for check
Take a risk for a check
As long as it's for a check
Keep the chips in check
Real niggas standard
And this is a real nigga anthem
This is a real nigga's standards
I am like one of the last ones
And this is a real nigga anthem
This is a real nigga's standards
I am like one of the last ones
Most of the real niggas passing
And most of the real niggas...
This is a real nigga anthem
This is a real nigga's standards
