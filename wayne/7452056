1 ContributorLollipop LyricsI said he so sweet
I wanna lick the wrapper
And he, he licked me like a lollipop
Like a lollipop
Shorty wanna go?
Bottles in the club
He said “shorty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps”
Shorty wanna go?
Bottles in the club
He said “shorty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps"
Lil cutie had a swag like mine
He even wore his hair
Down his back like mine
He makes me feel right
When it’s wrong, like lyin'
Man he ain't never
Had a love like mine
And man I ain't ever
Seen a ass like that
All in my mind
Had mе lost for words
You might also likeI told him back it up
Like work work
Then he madе it jump
Like twerk twerk
And that's when he
He licked me like a lollipop
Like a lollipop
Shorty wanna go?
Bottles in the club
He said “shorty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps”
Shorty wanna go?
Bottles in the club
He said “shorty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps”
Won't you get on your knees
Won't you get on your knees
Call me so I can make it juicy for you
Call me so I can get it juicy for you
Call me so I can make it juicy for you
Call me so I can get it juicy
Call me so I can make it juicy for you
Call me so I can get it juicy for you
Call me so I can make it juicy for you
Call me so I can get it juicy
Shorty wanna go?
Bottles in the club
He said “shorty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps”
Shorty wanna go?
Bottles in the club
He said “shorty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps”
Won't you get on your kneesEmbed
