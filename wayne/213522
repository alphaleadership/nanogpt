My name Tunechi Bitch. First name Tunechi, last name Bitch and I ain't no bitch, bitch. But it's Tunechi Bitch and right now I'm here checkin' in for the motherfuckin' Appreciation
Hey yo, Stevie, what volume is it?
Volume motherfuckin' four, nigga. Like I said this is the motherfuckin' Appreciation Volume 4
Who the fuck is Stevie J? If you don't know by now, nigga you motherfuckin' stupid, nigga. Fuck wrong with you? Live on Sundays and money every motherfuckin' days, nigga. Fuck wrong with these niggas, Stevie? I told these little bitch ass niggas, it's YMCMB. Truckfit, truk the world, truk your girl, Drake or Mack Maine probably fucked your girl. Not me, not me
I don't fuck around like that, I don't do that. Why? 'Cause I appreciate life and I appreciate shit. We here to talk about appreciation, see I done turned this from a drop to a skit Stevie, see you get some-you never know what you get when you fuckin' with me, come on we about to do this shit
Let me show you, hold on, let me talk about appreciation. Hold on, what do I appreciate? Umm, hmm, I appreciate good kush, yes. Mmmhmm, I'm on probation though so I can't really be fuckin' with it like that. And, uh, I appreciate good pussy, of course. But I don't get too much 'cause I work hard and I skate even harder
