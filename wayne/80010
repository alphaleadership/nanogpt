20 ContributorsEnough of No Love Lyrics
Ayy
(Young Mula baby, yeah)
Yâ€™all ready?

I admit that you almost had me
I admit I was almost crazy
Had me thinkin' 'bout callin' that bitch at night
And let her know where she can come and meet me
But it's cool, I'ma be a lady
She thinks she cute, but she don't phase me
And if you knew about all of this good love you'll be missin' out on
You wouldn't have played me

Can't say I'm not hurt
I'll be damned if I'm broken
What we had is now hers
Let her know she can have it

'Cause I can't stay here
If there's no love
Yeah, I can't stay here
'Cause I've had enough
Enough of no love, enough of no love
No love, no love
You might also like
And I admit that I thought about creeping
So you could get a dose of how I feel
'Cause our hearts can never seem to break even
But what's the use, I'd rather pack it up and leave it
'Cause here we are again, 'cause you're wrong again
You're tryin' to tell me that you love me
'Cause your actions say another thing

Can't say I'm not hurt (Can't say)
I'll be damned if I'm broken (Broken)
What we had is now hers (Whoa)
Let her know she can have it

'Cause I can't stay here
If there's no love (Can you hear me, lady?)
Yeah, I can't stay here (Put your hands in the air)
'Cause I've had enough
Enough of no love, no, no, enough of no love

Tunechi, hm, uh
Why you worry 'bout that other ho?
'Cause that other ho ain't worry 'bout another ho
Yeah, you say it's over, but you still fussin'
You just clumsy, always tripping over nothin'
That other bitch is just that other bitch
I give her space and give you the mother ship
We can't let her tear down what we built
I told you if you ride or die then I'll be your seat-belt
In sickness and in health for rich poor and I stay rich
But love is a bitch and bitches ain't shit
And I'm ridin' with a girl name Keisha smokin' on keysh, uh
'Cause I, I can't stay here (Young Mula baby, yeah)
If there's no love (i know i can't)
I can't stay here
'Cause I've had enough (I've had enough)
Enough of no love (No love, no love)
'Cause I, I can't stay here
If there's no love
(You ain't got no love for me, you ain't got no love for me)13Embed
