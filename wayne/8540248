5 ContributorsNever Fake It Lyrics
Them things standing on with their gun for 'em
Heavy in a couple cities, don't tell the informers
Chevy sixteen inches, ten switches
Drop top, old school, whole ten bitches
Fold 'em riches, get both for them digits
No near nigga compare the young
Nut some low ho prepare your tongue, yeah
The game been hurtin' and I'm the medicine, ahead of my 
At the rest of 'em, motherfuck 'em
I'm the boy on fire like Corduroy
Reppin' the ghetto, I get money forever
I got two clips stick together, that's a hunnid, whatever
Lovin' the cheddar
Ca-Call me "mozzarella", is no sweat
I could hustle in the hottest weather
I'm , fucking baby, let's 
BS, a few shots to whoever, yay (Ayy, ayy)

Life is what you make it, I could never fake it
It is what it is, so I'm forced to embrace it
Life is what you make it, I could never fake it
I'm on another level like Neo in The Matrix
Life is what you make it, I could never fake it
It is what it is, so I'm forced to embrace it
Life is what you make it, I could never fake it
I'm on another level like Neo in The Matrix
Life is what you make it, I could never fake it
All I see is green, you could say I'm kinda racist
Never settle for less, I'm far from the basic
And I'ma get minds even if I've gotta take it
You might also like
And I'ma get minds even if I've gotta take it (Ayy)
I'm on another level like Neo in The Matrix (Look)

Money's never no issue, I stay wetted like tissue
My house cold like the igloo, it's crazy what I've been through
No chit-chat, I'm with that, you want that, you get that
Got a bus for like , no cap it when I spit that
I don't care where your team at, I piss on your team hat
All I know is hustle, so I stay up on my grizzle
I'm way over your head, you could say I spin in riddles
Everything I do is big like the opposite of little

Life is what you make it, I could never fake it
It is what it is, so I'm forced to embrace it
Life is what you make it, I could never fake it
I'm on another level like Neo in The Matrix
Life is what you make it, I could never fake it
All I see is green, you could say I'm kinda racist
Never settle for less, I'm far from the basic
And I'ma get minds even if I've gotta take it

And I'ma get minds even if I've gotta take it
I'm on another level like Neo in The MatrixEmbed
