Yeah bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
Can't see you little niggas cause the money in the way
And I'm - I'm sitting high, a gansta ride, blades
If you ain't gonna ride fly than you might as well hate
Shit, I gotta eat, yeah, even though I ate
No it ain't my birthday but I got my name on my cake
Shit, believe that: if your mans wanna play

Shorty, 98's, 45 paper plates
Tint the whole thang, big money heavyweight
A hundred stacks, spend 50 on a Caddy, 25 on the pinky
Bought a pound of blow and bounced back
Matching grills, big houses on the hill
Got them hoes in the kitchen all cooking, paying bills
I start to holler, dollar after dollar
Flipping chickens, getting tickets. Want the money and the power
Born Stunna, Uptown hunter
3rd ward G, nigga, been about money
(3rd ward G, nigga, been about money)
(3rd ward G, nigga, been about money)
Stuntin' like my daddy, stuntin' like my daddy
And I be stuntin' like my daddy, stuntin' like my daddy
And I be stuntin' like my daddy, stuntin' like my daddy
And I be stuntin' like my daddy, stuntin' like my daddy
And I be s-, Young Stunna, and I be s-, Young Stunna
And I be stuntin' like my daddy, stuntin' like my daddy
And I be s-, Young Stunna, and I be s-, Young Stunna
And I be stuntin' like my daddy, stuntin' like my daddy
And I be
