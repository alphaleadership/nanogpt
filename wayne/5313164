10 ContributorsNothing Nice Lyrics
808 Mafia

Roll up the Mochi (Mochi)
Puff in the back, I'm low-key (Low-key)
Cut it, cut it like O.T. (O.T.)
Dunk on your bitch like Kobe (Kobe)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dunk on your bitch like Bron Bron (Bron Bron)
Lil bitch throw back like Sean John (Sean John)
Dolla bounce back like Sean Don (Sean Don)

Nothing nice (Nothing nice)
It's nothing (It's nothing)
Nothing nice (Nothing nice)
It's nothing (It's nothing)
Nothing nice (Nothing nice)
It's nothing, yeah (It's nothing, yeah)
Nothing nice (Nothing nice)
It's nothing, yeah

Yeah, Lil Tunechi nothing nice
Pull up on your lil' bitch in that ghost, she come to life
Yeah, private plane, masseuses on the flight
We on our way to Houston
Straight to Houston for them pints, oh
Your main bitch my side bitch
Insane lips and side tips
She drain it, she dry it, ok
She drink it, that's vibrant
She think it, that's awkward
Go anal, that's hybrid, ok-k-k
You ain't lit to fire me
We ain't even thinking, we bring this to scientists
Propane and butane drip
That can only mean that Lil Tunechi hit a fire lick
These niggas acting that's all
We got some films to make
I met the devil today
He did not know what the hell to say
Momma told me, don't say nothing at all
If you ain't got something nice to say
I got something nice to say
I cannot feel my face, oh
