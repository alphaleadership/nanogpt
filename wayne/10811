2 ContributorsBring Da Pain Lyrics
Wha-Wha, Wha, wha
Cash Money, wha, wha, wha
Hot Boy$, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, w-wha, look

What it be like
Get inside 'fore street lights
17 right
I represent 'til I fall under the dirt boy
I run wit' Juvenile, B.G., and Turk boy
And we the hottest, of the hottest, of the damn hot
In helicopters with my parters over land, huh
Now listen, I be wit killaz, guerillas, ridaz and head bustas
Drug dealers, wig splittas, and fed duckas
Don't be with no false man, haters, or rat niggas
They come around and I bust 'em in they cat kissers
Ya understand?

Now I done warned you not to battle me
I leave more casualties than the dollar bills in your salaries
Snapin' these bitches into reality
Cryin' and pain, blind by the chain
Niggas can't deny the reign
It's a shame when I cock it back
And it be like chill, on the real
Ain't no stoppin' the black, under attack
Nigga stuntin' and thumpin', all of y'all, the niggas stuffin
And like Michael Jackson, they always be startin somethin'
You might also like
We bring da pain, with the muthafuckin' choppers in hand
504, Cash Money, droppin' niggas like rain
Bout to leave your body stankin'
Nigga fuck what you sayin'
Lil Keenan, Blaxuede, and Turk, Lil Wayne
We bring da pain, with the muthafuckin' choppers in hand
504, Cash Money, droppin' niggas like rain
Bout to leave your body stankin'
Nigga fuck what you sayin'
Lil Keenan, Blaxuede, and Turk, Lil Wayne

I'm Quick to put in Work, put your face on a T-Shirt
Who that be 'bout combat, that be that nigga Turk
Get down and filthy for mine at any time, woadie
And I slang iron for mine, you're outta line, woadie
A  guerilla, once I start ain't no stoppin' it
When I start to cockin' it, bodies gon' be droppin' it
I hit your set with fifty plus fifty more
I catch you down bad and I ain't gon' let you go

I done came from the motherland, no other man standin'
Standin' with the country that be standin' on this planet
From way back in line, to gettin' recognized
And lettin' niggas know what's ion my motherfuckin' mind
From a karaoke to a trophy
From not havin' it all to mostly
To Larry King tryin' to host me
And Jay Leno, came from the local in the N.O
To nationwide with my own ride with tinted windows
From the 1996 Black Limo Rental
To a private Jet Flyin' me to Sacramento
From working in Winn-Dixie, to duets with Whitney
From Mad Dogg and Whiskey, to MoÃ«t 'til tipsy
From class to business, that's from rags to riches
Slowin' down from them poes to tryin' to pass them bitches
From, "Girl he too black", to, "Girl, Who that?"
From a lower 9 shack to where I'm livin' at
I done came a long road my nigga, just peep game
I done came from James Holmes my nigga, to Blaxuede
And it's like that
W-Wha, Wha, Wha
W-Wha, Wha, Wha
W-Wha, Wha, Wha
W-Wha, Wha, Wha

We bring da pain, with the muthafuckin' choppers in hand
504, Cash Money, droppin' niggas like rain
Bout to leave your body stankin'
Nigga fuck what you sayin'
Lil Keenan, Blaxuede, and Turk, Lil Wayne
We bring da pain, with the muthafuckin' choppers in hand
504, Cash Money, droppin' niggas like rain
Bout to leave your body stankin'
Nigga fuck what you sayin'
Lil Keenan, Blaxuede, and Turk, Lil Wayne

Pain nigga
We bring the pain nigga
We bring the pain nigga
We bring the pain nigga
We bring the pain nigga
We bring the pain nigga
We bring the pain nigga
Blaxuede, Turk, Wayne, bring the pain
That nigga Keenan, bring the pain
We bring the pain nigga (Nigga)
We bring the pain nigga (Nigga)
We bring the pain nigga
Wha, WhaEmbed
