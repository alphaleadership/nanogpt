New Orleans soldier, we wear a bunch of camo'
We wear a bunch of chains, Lord knows they once was shackles
Next time they say your name, they have to light a candle
Boy, just stay in your lane and that bitch tight and narrow
Huh, too much on my Arm and Hammer, too much propaganda
I got this vodka handled without no Tropicana
Lord, I been Hollygrove since it's not enough
Got the pot to piss in, now that's a pot of gold
I been shoppin' for, now it's lock-and-load
Boy, I'm so lit, I'm 'bout to stop, drop and roll
Seventeen, was a nigga with a lot of hoes
'Bout to go hit me a lick like a envelope
