5 ContributorsThunder* LyricsLyrics from Snippets

Uh
Clickity-clickity
Look at me
Look at me
Dripping and cripping
On the hip of me
Clip-

Crash on the scene
Ash on the seat
Flash on my teeth
Stay on my toes
Like glass on my feet
Stash all my niggas
Im a wholesale mat more than me
Ask Marley G
Ask Pauly D
Where in Jersey Shore
I move in all streets
Bags on your head and on your feet
Bullets in your head and artery
That part of me
The X-rated
Trying to black card me
And how hard it be
None of y'all niggas not hard to beat
None of y'all...See A$AP Rocky LiveGet tickets as low as $312You might also like1Embed
