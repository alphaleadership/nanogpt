30 ContributorsHold Me Back (Remix) Lyrics
Untouchable empire, double MG
Rich, young niggas, you hear me? (M-M-M-Maybach Music)
Yeah

I swerve in my Porsche, I cruise in my Chevy
Her pussy deep as my voice, my Cuban links heavy
I just bought out the bar, got these bitches so thirst'
Entertainment for women, my niggas ride for a verse
I'm hustling global, I stunt like a champ
All these boy scouts soldiers, fuck you and your camp
Got on all of my jewels, don't fall for the trap
I got one of my fools, he don't listen to rap
But he listen to me, so listen to me
When you listen to me, I get you this in a week
Put a hater to sleep, the sky is the limit
I got R. Kelly money, when Fiesta was winning
I got my back to the wall, can I handle my business?
And I'm ready for war, niggas killing for pennies
See my focus was Ms, my chances were slim
Counting multiple millions, we should get this on film
When you lean on the state, then you're labeled a rat
On my feet so long, I won't fuck on my back, rrrat!

These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back, no!
See Rick Ross LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like
These niggas wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me down
Jail cells wanna hold me in
My bond paid, who finna hold me now?
I'm ten toes on my square, 'til they flip the switch on my chair
These niggas be fake as fuck but this official right here
Black Cadillac, scrap, 'bout to handle that
'Bout to fi-fi-fire until that barrel melt like candle wax
Drop the sack, Geronimo, I ain't counting, gotta go
Everywhere that dollar go, put more gold on my collarbone
You say you thuggin', you say you real, you say you gangsta, so call
Slide up with that oak out, everybody like "Oh God!"
Cut the deck, deal it out, bet I'll pull your ho card
Shit real, oh yah, thought it was a joke, huh?

These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back, no!
These dummies can't hold me back, these laws can't hold me back
Three banks can't hold these stacks, pin them hoes like Goldie Mack
Smoke 'til I panic, I got rich like I planned it
If there's a price on your head, on your roof, choppers we landin'
I used to play on that block, dark liquor and candles
Now you look in my lot, rose Ferraris and Lambos
Talkin South Bronx, Al Qaeda, Rozay, Meek Mill, Wale
Blow mils like a ball player, Magic to Bird, Isiah
Shorty tryna kick it, looking for that meal ticket
Diamonds splashin', gon' flick it, on that Juicy J they trippin'
I done came up off a lick, boy, got you on a list, boy
Your life on my wrist, boy, niggas need a fix, boy

These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back, no!

These niggas tryna hold me back, these niggas tryna bake me in
These niggas ain't putting in work, these niggas gotta hate to win
Us niggas don't play no games, my niggas gon' shoot them thangs
Real life in that 901, real niggas, we don't mess with lames
305 all about that life, million dollars, I spent that twice
Dope boy, yeah that my life, crack kills but I spit that white
These niggas tryna study my grind, these niggas wanna see me shine
These niggas wanna take my spot, fuck boy you done had your time
These niggas act just like hoes, these niggas ain't got no heart
These niggas ain't fly like us, million dollars in my garage
Two million house on the lake, five million in real estate
Green slips in them Ds boy, that Maybach right on the way
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back, no!

Uh, Turk came home, B.G. in the Feds
Your ho on my list, it's longer than Craig's
My bitch got cramps, she on the edge
Ball on these niggas, like I cut off my dreads
Okay, I'm so-so-so me, like needle and thread
Hit your ass with this yopper, all it leave is your legs
My cousin fighting a case, I hope he beat it like eggs
You niggas thinkin' you fly, that flight delayed
And then I look at my bitch, I tell her "Wake up"
She sleep butt naked, I sleep in my Truks
I smoke when I fuck, I fuck when I want
Between her legs, five-star restaurant
Man my life is a porn, leave your head on your horn
You niggas honey dijon, my weed loud as alarms
I'm on the beach, nigga, where the hoes be at
Got street niggas to hold that gat
Them niggas gon hold me down
And these niggas can't hold me back, Tunechi

These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back, no!
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back, no!
