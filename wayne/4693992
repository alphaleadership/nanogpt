4 ContributorsG-Code Lyrics
Okay, I stick to the G-code, gun by my feet
Since a pussy got lips, I guess you niggas could speak
I fuck with gorillas, bust at the feds
I bet your mouth can't run if I cut off your legs
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code

Okay, I stick to the G-code, no wonder you don’t know
I'll wreck you from head to toe
Bitch nigga, I'll cut your throat
I come out the labyrinth, I got a couple bad habits
You know a  I’ve been granted so it's gon' help me to manage
 never would panic, I got the heart of a savage
It might come with some baggage but I'm strong like I'm Sampson
Hella eyes like a peacock, hella kicks like it's Reebok
Soaking up all the sun like the top of a tree top
My roots  physics when I'm around
 not written down 
 and we rocking now
Shit, I'm never looking down
In the water but never drown
Keep it quiet, don’t make a sound
These niggas be talking but they really ain’t with the shit
My brothers don't talk, we keep it quiet, no loose lips
I’m down 
No pussy, no punk bitch
My niggas we all in it
Tryna find me? Just follow the

Okay, I stick to the G-code, gun by my feet
Since a pussy got lips, I guess you niggas could speak
I fuck with gorillas, bust at the feds
I bet your mouth can't run if I cut off your legs
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code

I got you pussies on hush like I just pressed mute
Larry Bird in the clip so I don't miss when I shoot
Turn your body convertible, now you're missing the roof
When I breathe on the beat I got these fuck niggas spooked
Got these rappers all wondering why they ain’t blown
Like the streets don't know 'bout them fake ass flows
Always talking 'bout guns but they ain't ready to kill
It's like some fuckin' construction the way I stay with a drill
Know some certified killers that'll tell you I'm ill
Hella dirt on my boots like I just ran through a field
Got me praying to God, ask the Lord for forgiveness
'Cause if these snitches start talking then I'ma murder the witness
Got these sticks swingin' 'round like it was some num-chuks
Bet I knock his ass out with the end of this gun butt
Then I make him kiss my Chucks, yeah, Robbery sho' 'nuff
I stick to the G-code, I was destined to blow up
Okay, I stick to the G-code, gun by my feet
Since a pussy got lips, I guess you niggas could speak
I fuck with gorillas, bust at the feds
I bet your mouth can't run if I cut off your legs
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code

I'm number one, you a zero, I'm dope like a kilo
Keep my lips sealed, pussy, 'cause I stick to the G-code
Look out for the RICO, don't  to them peoples
I see decoy, I'm D-boy, fly like an eagle, yeah
Real gangsta, real rapper
My young hood niggas fool around and clap ya
And all these actors, my guns flash like cameras
So go and smile for the barrel of the 
Pussy ass nigga, rookie ass nigga
Over here you'll get crumbled like a cookie ass nigga
Ain't no chit-chat when we get back
Niggas click-clack, niggas skip that
We mob out, we ride out
Bullets fly out with an impact
And leave a motherfucker leaking like we did that
Who was that motherfucker in a fit-black?
I sip 'yac then I take a piss
And I shit on these niggas like the bullet that I is
Okay, I stick to the G-code, gun by my feet
Since a pussy got lips, I guess you niggas could speak
I fuck with gorillas, bust at the feds
I bet your mouth can't run if I cut off your legs
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code
Okay, I stick to the G-code1Embed
