16 ContributorsAK-47 Lyrics
I use to tote a .38; I tote that AK-47
In my crack days; in my rap days

I used to tote a .38 up in my crack days
I used to tote a .38 up in my crack days
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days
I used to tote a .38
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days
I used to tote a .38 up in my crack days
I tote that AK-47

I'm too fly, can't stay up in my bat cave
Hello, say goodbye when the gat wave
Hold on to your surf board when the gat wave
Homie, you can be deleted like backspace
I'm comin' through like a fax page
I'm just a gorilla in a unlatched cage, I peel off like black tape
Weed & Syrup, good combination like a cracked safe
Uhmm, real nigga in the buildin', where the Cris at?
I got them twins with me, you know, click-clack
I got them M's with me, you know, big stacks
I stay on the right side when that bridge crack
Cash Money, everything understood, everybody hop on a Lil Wayne that could
Haha, Hollygrove, that's my hood, Eagle Street is where I stood, boy!

I used to tote a .38 up in my crack days
I used to tote a .38 up in my crack days
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days
I used to tote a .38
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days
I used to tote a .38 up in my crack days
I tote that AK-47

See when I saw my first murder, I was only seven
Four years after that, I did my first 211
A 211 that turned to a 187
The block was dialing 911 for the 411
We left the 7/11, looking ike 9-11
They skipped the doctor and the ambulance
And they called the reverend
See that was then, homie, and this is now, bredren
I'm this close from copping the Porsche 911
The 911, that's the reason for my A-R
The M-14 is for my nigga J-R
See I don't feel too many rappers, 'cause they are
Softer than girls in Catholic school
Y'all boys rap like y'all went to acting school
I thank my beef, the guns show 'em gratitude
Young Money, whether we're traveling or not, we pack a tool
Why N.W.A., them niggas with attitudes
I used to tote a .38 up in my crack days
I used to tote a .38 up in my crack days
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days
I used to tote a .38
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days
I used to tote a .38 up in my crack days
I tote that AK-473Embed
