14 ContributorsAnti-Hero Lyrics
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up

I ain't no hero, I guess I'm a villian
I got the kilo, I stretch it, I bend it
She got the pre-roll, I snatch it, I lit it
I got an ego on sex and she get it
Fuck her in public, that's sex in the city
Bust me a nut, then step back, hit my griddy
On an opp, I roll up like a pack of that sticky
If an opp try to run, hit his back up like Ricky (Blat)
All of my guns hold a hundred
Blunt full of gas, all my cars motor runnin'
All y'all boys know runnin'
Real pimp shit, turn all y'all hoes into money
All y'all owe me some money
Rich nigga, still kill, all y'all owe me some money
Wake up taped up, I turn all y'all boys into mummies

I ain't no hero, but I'm still a legend
I go from zero to 187
I feel likе Tebow, I'm ballin' forever
I feel likе Reno, I bust with the Desert
I keep me a kilo on top of my dresser
I fuck me a freak ho on top of my dresser, yeah
Eat the ho out and digest her, yeah
Keep the ho out of my dresser
You might also like
I ain't no hero, but I'm still a legend
I go from zero to AK-47
I'm a carpedo, you follow directions
It's murder she wrote in capital letters
I put the dreams in the bag and I sell 'em
Feel like Magneto, bang bang with this metal
I got machine guns, my matchin' machetes
I ain't no hero, I guess I'm the villain
I ain't a hero but I'm still a villian
I got some hundreds that's stuck to the ceiling
Hop on the beat and I'm causin' a killin'
I'm with the squad, they don't care 'bout your feelings
Tunechi just sent it, he said, "Tecca, kill it"
I be worried 'bout Benji's, I'm worried 'bout digits
If I step on your block, then we spinnin' like fidgets
Better watch out, they hoppin' right out by that Civic

Two-tone bag, I'm steady winnin', oh you so mad
She givin' top and my phone on flash
I'm in some shit they ain't know about yet
Heard she a thot, I don't know about that
Movin' funny, how I go about that?
Watch your back, I don't know about that
Never lack, we ain't goin' out sad, yeah
Better just mind your business, yeah
Quiet around here, no visits, yeah
She fell in love, how I'm livin', yeah
I ain't a hero, but I'm still a villain, yeah
Hundreds, they stuck to the ceiling, yeah
Broken, I cannot heal it, yeah
Stolen, I do not feel it, yeah
Know that I'm in the building, yeah
I ain't no hero, I guess I'm a villian
I got the kilo, I stretch it, I bend it
She got the pre-roll, I snatch it, I lit it
I got an ego on sex and she get it
Fuck her in public, that's sex in the city
Bust me a nut, then step back, hit my gritty
On an opp, I roll up like a pack of that sticky
If an opp try to run, hit his back up like Ricky (blat)
All of my guns hold a hundred
Blunt full of gas, all my cars motor runnin'
All y'all boys know runnin'
Real pimp shit, turn all y'all hoes into money
All y'all owe me some money
Rich nigga, still kill, all y'all owe me some money
Wake up taped up, I turn all y'all boys into mummies

I ain't no hero, but I'm still a legend
I go from zero to AK-47
I'm a carpedo, you follow directions
It's murder she wrote in capital letters
I put the dreams in the bag and I sell 'em
Feel like Magneto, bang bang with this with metal
I got machine guns, my matchin' machetes
I ain't no hero, I guess I'm the villain
I ain't a hero but I'm still a villian (Yeah)
I got some hundreds that's stuck to the ceiling (Yeah)
Hop on the beat and I'm causin' a killin' (Yeah)
I'm with the squad, they don't care 'bout your feelings (No)
Tunechi just sent it, he said, "Tecca, kill it"
I be worried 'bout Benji's, I'm worried 'bout digits
If I step on your block, then we spinnin' like fidgets
Better watch out, they hoppin' right out by that Civic (Bitch)2Embed
