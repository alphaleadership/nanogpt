51 ContributorsMe and My Drank Lyrics
Uh-huh
Yeah, I'm in the lab, no pad, no pen
Just a styrofoam cup I can pour a four in

Up in the studio, me and my drank
Deezle on the beat, and let me do my thing
Thinking 'bout a certain, certain somebody
That perfect somebody, sexy purple body
She got service road curves, and highway eyes
The road to her soul, just follow the road signs
And holler if you hear me, I love it when she's near me
I hate when she's away, and Satan'll see the day
That Hell freeze over before I let her go
And let one of you bitch niggas get her; no, no, no
You don't know how to treat her
You don't know that I need her
Hey, do you know that I need you?
'Cause baby, right now, it feel like the whole world is against me
Ever since the death of Pimp C

But me, I'm up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
I'm up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
And you sit on 24's, I sip on 24's
You sit on 24's, I sip on 24's
Drop a four in a 20 ounce and call it 24's
Drop a four in a 20 ounce and call it 24's

I'm riding out, leaning, never nodding out
My girl tripping, damn I gotta hear my momma mouth
My homeboys say I should slow down a little
But that shit I'm on make me slow down a lot
You bottle-pop, I buy a bottled pop
Drop some syrup in it, get out my Waffle House
I live in Wayne's World, represent our South
And this how we do it, do it in our South

One more ounce'd make me feel so great
Wait, now I can't feel my face
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
Will somebody please, please, double-cup me?
And everybody please, please, don't judge me
Will somebody please, please, double-cup me?
And everybody please, please, don't judge me

Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank (Yeah) me-me-me and my drank
Now for all y'all who ain't heard of him
Mr. M-O-E, the Barre Baby
Was a Southside living legend
The 3rd Ward, bone hard, street veteran
And it all started in '93
High school, he was the fool, he was only 18
With the dreams of becoming a ghetto superstar
Rollin' in foreign cars through the streets of 3rd Ward
It was all momma leave 'em with, a trace of Mo-E
And promethazine, now he the codeine fiend
And his team was the coldest, every day they rolled thick
Niggas and hoes on dick 'cause that's that Screwed Up Click

The Barre Baby, the Barre Baby, Barre Baby
Yeah, I sip that Big Moe, I drink that Pimp C
Rest in peace Big Moe, rest in peace Pimp C
I sip that Big Moe, I drink that Pimp C
Rest in peace Big Moe, rest in peace Pimp C
And fuck what they say
Mr. DJ Screw, I'ma do this for you

Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank (Yeah, yeah)
Me and my drank, me-me-me and my drank
I usually don't do this but, uh...
Yeah, T you gotta feel me
Sippin' on some drank the color purple like Celie
Really, they say I should chill before it kills me
But so will a car crash or a nine milli (That's true)
And I ain't even mention cigarettes or airplanes
So grab a Sprite, here's a pint we can share, Wayne
Yeah mayne, tastes so sweet
And I ain't gonna have a seat 'cause I don't wanna fall asleep
So just pour it in my drink and I'ma sip until I lean hard
Drank got me moving slower than a retard
So press record, and hear these hot raps (You know I got 'em)
I'm in the booth, cup on me like a jock-strap (I ain't lying)
And I will not nap until the bottle's empty
Then I pour a little more for Pat, Screw, and Pimp C (Rest in peace)
And I would stop, but believe that I can't
So 'til Short is gone, it's just me and my drank, my drank

Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me-me and my drank
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me-me and my drank

Me and my drank
Up in the studio, someone pour another four
Oh, oh, yeah
I told the bitch, one more ounce will make me feel so great
Wait, now I can't feel my face
Will somebody please, please, double cup me?
And tell the world please, please, don't judge me
Will somebody please, please, double cup me?
And everybody please, please, don't judge me
You sit on 24's, we sip on 24's
You sit on 24's; we, we, we
Drop a four in the 20 ounce and call it 24's
Drop a four in the 20 ounce and call it 24's
Yeah, I'm in the lab, no pad, no pen
Just a styrofoam cup I can pour a four in29Embed
