8 ContributorsNigga Like Me Lyrics

I tell em' da bitch ride da dick like a new Honda
Wit da cops behind her I'm kinda
Sorta watcha calla'
Superstar now some on tryin fuck some superstars mouth
Straight up and the guns come wit the money
And the work come with the luggage
Fuck it
These niggas talking big wit a rapper budget
I get paid off rappers buddy
And I ain't fuckin wit da rat pack
I pull up as any day wit some tap tap
And that's that
I'm the wildest from the the wolfpack
Back back
U ain't noting but a snack pack
And when u running don't look back
Cuz I'm be coming out dat back pack
Clap clap
And rrrat rrrat
Yaa young weeza
Money over bitches
Reporting to u motherfuckers live from da kitchen
You might also like
Hahaha a man Wayne dey gone be mad at this
I mean see niggas already hate u and hate what u do
Niggas already hate me and hate what I do
Them niggas gotta hate what we do

CLS Five hundred AMG kit
Know the haters be sick when I drive through
Ride through two miles an hour
So everybody sees me
Bumpin that Carter 2 my nigga Weezy
Whoo
F baby
F U Pay me
I hustleâ€¦ cops come I tell em F U Jay see
Catch me if you can I'm the gingerbread man
In the V8 all white sedan
I'm too cool
Inside butter yea tan in da seat
Same color as da sand in da beach
I'm too cool
And my money come in boot coozoo
So screw u broke dudes who hate me cuz I'm too cool
And u know I keep da piece on me
My gun speaks it own language like E-40 see shorty
Da piece pop ya your scream poppa
Too late your brains already beachcabla
