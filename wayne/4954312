3 Contributors24’s Lyrics
...see im a young new orleans nigga
With the block wide open
Standin in the kitchen with the crack pot smoking
I been whippin - i been stock
Gunnaz comin back ta 31 with no sola
I know niggas that a murder yo son with no motive
My dro come purple as plum
Im so loaded
You fuckin with a hustler
I get my coke bloated
You fuckin with a real gangsta - i tote .40s
And .45s - Glock .9s and thomes
Aks - ars never a dull moment
We SQAD 7 and yall phony
We got hard dicks
And yall on em like ponies
No faget
I get money all the time
Im a dough addict
And 2gs a wipe out your whole family
You tryna git at me
I show you sammy call him supa
And he only speak prices - get tha loot up
Yea its weezy f. - mister future
Though my future big
Im still quik ta shoot ya
Gotta big dick
Bitch git tha ruler
Homie you so quik ta lose her

You might also like
Yea - what tha fuck you niggas talkn about
Catch you walkin out yo house
Im white chalkin you out
We big dawgs what tha fuck you niggas barkin about
Young money muhafucka we tha talk of tha souf
Shit im kinda like lebron james
Hall of fame before i even got in the game
Its a god damn shame
But i, got that payin na drop that range
So i shop that caine and cop that range
And i try ta stay focus
Ta stay away from the streets
And them vultures
That my cake in my door
Weezy say keep ya head strait
J.you gon blow up
Til i hold up my head like a solja
I ain't never scared
I got a hawk with hot thunder and metal hands
Send a shot through your mecca gear
Watcha leather tear
I'm like juelz I'm a hard ta handle melon head
Hit a nigga in his melon head
He already dead
Ill put the flame ta ya nogen
Blaze shift ya fade
Give ya ass another line and no lying
See I'm in this lane driving
There's no stopping me
Tryin off is - so foul me
Or get a foul back
Eat up or you fouling if he follows
Smelling me prick
I leave ya ass foul as animal shit
Nigga I'm an animal - shit
Run with an animal clique
SQ guerillas keep banana clips
Make ya, get down on the floor
On some David Banner shit
Or put the rock into ya skull
Aiy band you quick
There's no band aids or bandages
Cuz man its just the brave in ya parents piss
And then, in a few days I'm at cha second line
Dancing as the bitch like ain't that a bitch
Left of crampy analyst
I got the greens and the prince
Got the weed goin admit
And I'm ripping that batter
Yea I got them bird for pualie
Don't want no cracker and prolly
Assault your cracker
When near a soft blast ya - bastard
