4 ContributorsEveryday Drugs Music (EDM) Lyrics
We gon' fuck them folks up, shawty
Ah-hem

Waaah
Check me out, nigga
My pockets fat, and they got they bellies out, nigga
Go ask yo' bitch about me, I bet she vouch nigga
Ah, I've been outside livin', you's a house nigga
I'm smokin' kush all day, pissin' promethazine
A thousand pictures on my phone, my bitch a selfie queen
I got some hitters on my side, they to my right my left
I got this gold around my neck, I feel like Michael Phelps
I got this gold around my neck, I feel like Michael Phelps
Was in the hole for thirty days, it made me fight myself
You know these hoes got dirty ways, that's why I like myself
I told a bad bitch I could do bad by myself, oh
My momma used to drive a Buick Skylark
Now she get the keys to my Bugatti, fuck it i'll walk
That's me and my young niggas skatin' up yo' sidewalk
Catch up with yo' bitch ass like 57 Heinz sauce
Lil Tunechi

I'ma hold you down like a concealed weapon
First meal of the day, and I don't mean breakfast
Shit, I done risked it all, fuck the circumstances
Any flight overseas, I take perocets'es
I fuck hoes in sections
And these hoes is sexy
And they know I'm flexin'
Right in yo' direction
And I'm motivated, to get the whole collection
Coutnin' big faces, I might get an erection
You know what I'm sayin', when I'm 'posed to be playin'
I'm more serious than a doctor that's holding your hand
With some tubes in yo' arm, tear drops from yo' mom
No father in sight, that's probably right
I'm impolite, no bark just bite
I pull up on bikes
Out the gutter like bowling, I got a few strikes
I got a few dykes
Got molly and cover, 'case you spendin' the night
2 Chainz, yeah
