Shit
Here I go like Mystikal
Bitch you bad, but you built like a testicle

Only once the drugs are done
I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, I get lifted)
(Yeah, yeah, so get lifted, yeah)
I feel like dying, I feel like dying

I am sittin' on the clouds
I got smoke coming from my seat
I can play basketball with the moon
I got the whole world at my feet
Playin' touch football on Marijuana Street
Or, in a marijuana field, you are so beneath my cleats
Get high, so high
That I feel like lying
Down in a cigar, roll me up and smoke me
'Cause (I feel like dying) -haha
You might also like
Only once the drugs are done
I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
I feel like dying, I feel like dying

Swimmin' laps around a bottle of Louis the XIII
Jumping off of a mountain into a sea of codeine
I'm at the top of the top, but, still I climb
And if I should ever fall, the ground will then turn to wine
Pop, pop
I feel like flying
Then I feel like frying
Then (I feel like dying)

Only once the drugs are done
I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
I feel like dying, I feel like dyingEmbed
