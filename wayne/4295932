61 Contributors2 Dollar Bill Lyrics
Yeah, I know that I'm winnin'
I'm winnin', I'm winnin', I'm winnin' (Wow)
Yeah, yeah, uh, I know that I'm winnin', I'm winnin' (Dos)
I'm winnin', I'm winnin', yeah
(Mustard on the beat, ho)
Yeah, I'm rare, I'm rare
I'm rare (This shit hard), I'm rare
I'm rare, I'm rare
I'm rare, I'm rare
Like a two-dollar bill
Like a two-dollar bill
Like a two-dollar bill
Like a two-dollar bill
I'm rare, I'm rare
I'm rare, I'm rare
I'm rare (Rare), I'm rare (Rare)
I'm rare (Yeah), I'm rare (Uh)

Spit cold shit, need Mucinex
Diamond chain 'round my neck with the crucifix
Got a family now so I gotta pipe down
'Fore a young ho fuck up my timeline
I wear my shades at night like Corey Hart
Stopped trappin' and the plug say I broke his heart
On a seafood diet, I don't fuck with pork
Foreign my safe drive, I got a lot of torque
Trap check, check, one two
She wanna split, dip, fondue
Shinin', I'm in the sunroom
Life a bitch so you better use a condom
I'm rare like a nigga that's loyal
I'm rare like a girl with me that ain't spoiled
I'm rare like Mr. Clean with hair
Yeah, I'm rare, uh
You might also like
Like a two-dollar bill
Like a two-dollar bill
Like a two-dollar bill
Like a two-dollar bill
I'm rare, I'm rare
I'm rare (Rare), I'm rare (Yeah)
I'm rare (Yeah), I'm rare (Yeah)
I'm rare (Yeah, yeah), I'm rare (Uh)

I'm rare, I promise, I swear
I'm high, mid-air, don't vomit up here
Like the 13th floor, fuck it, I'ma take the stairs
Like what 2 Chainz wears, shit's from Rio de Janeiro
I'm rare, like a commercial with Future and Cher
Like a cop that's fair, like a triple-double dare
I'm rare, really rare, you scared, you really scared
I'm where? I'm here and there, you stare, you disappear
Oh, yeah, that's really real, that flare, them semis tear
That trigger softer than hair, silencer's hearing-impaired
That's rare, shoot up a fair, that's rare, my goons don't care
They bears, might get the chair, who cares? They say their prayers
Oh yeah, the claps drop, I'm rare as Sasquatch
Get spared, trap house, codeine, mascot
I chill where it's hot, Brazil, backdrop, I'm real
Her ass not, I'm rare, Tunechi
Like a two-dollar bill (Mula)
Like a two-dollar bill (That's Mula)
Like a two-dollar bill (That's rare)
Like a two-dollar bill (That's rare)
I'm rare (I'm rare), I'm rare (I'm rare)
I'm rare (I'm rare), I'm rare (I'm rare)
I'm rare (I'm rare), I'm rare (I'm rare)
I'm rare (I'm rare), I'm rare (I'm rare)

Rare like real niggas, rare like 12 figures
Rare like wagu steak, rare like 88 Polaroid pictures
My bite is stronger than my bark, this shit like dog park
Treat a Bugatti just like a fuckin' go-kart (kart)
'Bout my business and my soil is my witness
Only fuck with real niggas, them fake niggas, I have to diss 'em
Fuck with 'em from a distance, I'm a tycoon
Hella sharks in this business, stay with a harpoon
I got game like Donald Goines
Start-up companies, cryptocurrency coins
Like a bicentennial quarter, I'm hella rare (Hella rare)
I've been hustlin' since I was in daycare (Daycare)
Now I'm a mothafuckin' millionaire (Millionaire)
Money longer than Diana Ross hair (Ross hair)
I'm rare like white running backs, these squares a box of Apple Jacks
I'm an innovator, a trend-setter, far from a copycat
I don't rap like none of you niggas, I'm one-of-one (One-of-one)
The baddest bitch in the world could suck my dick and I bet I won't cum, bitch
Like a two-dollar bill (I'm rare, I'm rare)
Like a two-dollar bill (I'm rare, I'm rare)
Like a two-dollar bill (I'm rare, I'm rare)
Like a two-dollar bill (Bitch)
I'm rare, I'm rare
I'm rare (Rare), I'm rare (Rare)
I'm rare (Rare), I'm rare (Rare)
I'm rare (Yeah), I'm rare (Uh)
I'm rare (I'm rare), I'm rare (I'm rare)
I'm rare (I'm rare), I'm rare (I'm rare)
I'm rare (I'm rare), I'm rare (I'm rare)
I'm rare (I'm rare), I'm rare (I'm rare)
I'm rare (I'm rare), I'm rare (I'm rare)
I'm rare (I'm rare), I'm rare (I'm rare)9Embed
