9 ContributorsNever Really Mattered (Demo) Lyrics
80s and 90s money, boy
Money
Just ball, baby, just ball, baby
Ain't nothing to me
Money ain't never been nothing to me
You understand me?
Ain't nothing to me
Ain't nothing to me
Spend as much as you feel baby
I told the bitch it's just money

It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Yeah

I'm about to start using hundred dollar bills to twist a kill, that's for real
We've been on the road to riches, I told Stunna pass the wheel
Man, I just bought a painting for half a mill, that's a steal
Shit, when I'm an artist myself for crying out loud, that's a tear
In a backyard, where the dog at? Driveway where the hogs at?
Can't beat this shit, nigga, Lord knows I fought back, I fought back
We live nigga, let's broadcast, you caught that
New car get brought back if that motherfucker don't haul ass
I swear I had a Lexus coupe, it was Pepsi blue
It was shockingly gorgeous, it was electro-cute
I need a screw, the loose change extra loose
I just give my bitch some loot, that shit like pressing mute, fuck it
You might also like
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Ain't nothing to me, money don't mean nothing to me
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Ain't nothing to me, money don't mean nothing to me
It ain't nothing to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
You understand me, love? You can take this jet
I know you ain't been out your neighborhood
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
You understand me? We going to another country with this chopper, this is ballin'
Yeah
You understand me? Blow a quarter mill

I'ma park my Royce on the grass at your bitch house
Talk that shit, I'm shit-mouth
I flip this money, baby
Watch that perfect dismount
I say thank God all my bills paid
Knock on wood, my mama good
Knock twice 'cause she gave me life
Don't forget that, your honor could
Man, niggas be jacking these days
Only thief I know is Robbin Hood
But I'll pay for that trial nigga
Gotta protect my lively-hood
Look at all the bullshit I've endured
My lawyer said I matured
Talking 'bout them dead presidents
Breath smell like embalming fluid
Vacation, vacation
Keep the weed in rotation
Don't give up the location
I'll send you back to population
Man, I feel like making donations
And I don't need no standing ovations
I bought my bitch some new shit
And told her I don't care if you break it, it's just money

It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Money don't matter
Money don't mean nothing to me
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
It ain't nothing to me, money don't mean nothing to me
It ain't nothing to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
You understand me, baby girl? You don't have no worries no more when you fuckin' with this
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
Money's never a problem
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I got money to burn, fire hazards
Lil Tune the monsoon
Cash Money mascot, it's hot under this costume
Got rugs I never stepped on
Beds I never effed on
I'm in that upper echelon
Your empty pockets echoing
I still ride for my niggas
Money don't change a gangster
And when I'm asked to pull a few strings
I pull 'em until they untangle
And I like nice things and bad bitches with cab fare
More money, more problems
I'm surprised I still got black hair
I feel like a vacation, vacation
We gon' need vaccination
Don't give up the destination
I'll send you back to population
Man, let's leave out our situations
Leave our tribulations
I got old money, generations
Where's my cheque book? I'm spending pages, it's just money

It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Some niggas might call it trickin', we call it takin' care of your broad
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga, yeah
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I swear to God we gon' ride high, and stay fly, and stay high
Yeah, yeah, yeah, money don't mean nothing to me
You understand me, baby?
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Ain't nothing, money don't mean nothing to me (Money, money)
It ain't nothing to me
Just ball, baby, just ball, baby

It don't mean nothing
I already paid that price
Money don't mean nothing
We do this shit every night
Yoppas in the middle of the ocean
Helipads, chefs
You understand me?
Baby, we ain't even gotta go to the mall
The mall will come to us
Just the prize of the life4Embed
