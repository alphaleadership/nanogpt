43 ContributorsWe Outchea Lyrics
Real life
Ace Hooooood, yea
We the motherfuckin’ best, huh?
Lil bro you know I got you

I made my way from the bottom and I’m grindin’ (I’m grindin’)
I wake up every morning lookin’ for commas (for commas)
‘Bout my dollars (yeah)
I’m goin’ all out and that’s on my mama (on my mama)
On my mama

Yeahhhh
Cause we outchea (we outchea)
We outchea (we outchea)
Ain’t no sleepin’ (ain’t no sleepin’)
Cause we outchea (cause we outchea)
And we outchea (and we outchea)
We outchea (we outchea)
Grindin’ all damn night, cause we outchea

Uh, everyday that I wake nigga, I’mma say my prayers (amen)
I’mma get on my grind dawg and my mama need a new crib (amen)
And I’mma make that shake, gotta put the food on they plate
Stay focused and get money, never gave a fuck what they say
Ain’t no time to sleep, I get guap
Ain’t no Jordan’s in the shoe box
Ain’t no roof that came with that drop
Chase that paper, youngin’ don’t stop
Nigga I was born and raised in that jungle
Tryna to get my folk and them out that struggle
Fuck that nine to five, it don’t cut
Ain’t no job I guess that’s my luck
Yeah, nigga outchea and that's every day
Tryna triple what I made today
This one here for my real niggas
And bad bitches who gettin’ cake
Count it up till your thumbs hurt
Put fam second and God first
Hatin’ niggas ain’t phasin’ me
You couldn’t walk a mile in my footwear
You might also like
I made my way from the bottom, and I'm grindin'
I wake up every morning lookin' for commas
Bout my dollars; I'm goin' all out
And that's on my mama, on my mama (yeeeah)

Yeahhhh
Cause we outchea (we outchea)
We outchea (we outchea)
Ain’t no sleepin’ (ain’t no sleepin’)
Cause we outchea (cause we outchea)
And we outchea (and we outchea)
We outchea (we outchea)
Grindin’ all damn night, cause we outchea

Uh, money over the best pussy
The blind hear me, the deaf lookin’
When opportunity knock, I ran out the back door
Shit I thought it was the cops, damn
I fuck the bitch with a broom stick
The same broom that I didn’t clean my room with
Stay on my toes, no ballet
Shout out my Zoe’s, Sak Pase
I’m twistin’ weed in my mansion
I go dumber than Lamont Sanford
Remember when moms couldn’t afford Pampers
Now she trying to avoid cameras
All I do is count my blessings, Weezy F for Fortunate
I came up from that bottom, now I’m richer than chocolate
Lil Tunechi
I made my way from the bottom, and I'm grindin'
I wake up every morning lookin' for commas
Bout my dollars; I'm goin' all out
And that's on my mama, on my mama (yeeeah)

Yeahhhh
Cause we outchea (we outchea)
We outchea (we outchea)
Ain’t no sleepin’ (ain’t no sleepin’)
Cause we outchea (cause we outchea)
And we outchea (and we outchea)
We outchea (we outchea)
Grindin’ all damn night, cause we outchea

I say another day, another dollar
Thank the Lord for my praying mama
Watch ya back in this cold world
Cause everybody won’t see tomorrow
Money called and I’m motivated
Kill the beat, it’s premeditated
Still remember like yesterday when them hard times had me frustrated
Say any day, I’mma go and get it
Pair of J’s and my Florida fitted
Quittin’ not in my vocab and no hate is found in my soul and spirit
Young nigga trying to feed the fam
Hatin’ on me, I don’t give a damn
Out here like what nigga?
You don’t get the picture like Instagram
Hundred dollars to a couple grand
Couple grand to a hundred bands
Hundred bands to them big Ms
And my weight up like six gyms
I’m outchea and I mean that
We The Best, where my team at?
Bad vibes, I don’t need that
I done came too far to be lookin’ back
I made my way from the bottom, and I'm grindin'
I wake up every morning lookin' for commas
Bout my dollars; I'm goin' all out
And that's on my mama, on my mama (yeeeah)

Yeahhhh
Cause we outchea (we outchea)
We outchea (we outchea)
Ain’t no sleepin’ (ain’t no sleepin’)
Cause we outchea (cause we outchea)
And we outchea (and we outchea)
We outchea (we outchea)
Grindin’ all damn night, cause we outchea

Young Mula babyyy
Ace Hood nigg’
Fuck these old bitch ass niggas21Embed
