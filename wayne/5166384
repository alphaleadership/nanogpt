7 ContributorsWorld on My Shoulders Lyrics
Olympicks
Uh
Yeah
Elz, what's poppin? Yeah
Shit, we got these niggas like white folks 500 years ago, man
Haha
Uh, let's go

Long time coming, I can't feel my fuckin' face
Weezy on the track, murder was the fuckin' case
Me? I just be chillin' like a villain off a killing
I could have my goons clean you out like penicillin
I could paint the walls with yo' blood like acrylic
Chopper leave you with a half back, Corey Dillon
Michael Jackson, off the wall, Weezy, no ceilings
And bitch, I'm still ballin' like Bo Diddley
Yeah, let's do this shit, I do this shit
Scary movie on my hip, keep a extra movie clip
Weezy F. Baby, and tonight, the F for foolishness
Two pony tails, damn right, Punky Brewster, bitch
I'm sicker than your granny, take the baby, kill the nanny
Get a blind ho pregnant, she'll never see the baby daddy
I'm a addict, a addict for suck, swallow and slave
You pussy ass niggas got me turning in my grave
You might also like
I got the whole fuckin' world on my shoulders
And I got everybody breathing down my back
And I try to get high to get over
Now you can catch a nut or catch a contact
Yeah, I got the whole fuckin' world on my shoulders
And I got everybody breathing down my back
And I try to get high to get over
Now you can catch a nut or catch a contact
Yeah

I don't give a shit ho, you can kiss my dick hole
Don't snort no shit, won't be no shit
But you can't tell that to this nose
Got the world on the end of my fish pole
Bad bitches at my dispose
Fuck you talking 'bout, bitch? I ain’t cold, I'm Nat King Cole
I unload, then I reload
Put the gun to your earlobe
I'll rob anybody, shit, I'll rob a Dinero
Shout out to my heroes, Mary Jane and Lor-i-tab
I'm so swagged out, I put your head in her Louis bag
I'm off the wall, I'm off the motherfuckin' wall, y'all
I'll put a bitch through hell with gasoline drawers on
It's like my minds a parking lot, but all the cars gone
And seein' pussies get shot, give me a hard on
Pause, some of these niggas is the laws
And some of these blood suckers need straws
Yeah, it's Weezy Baby, mothafucka
I'll D.O.A them motherfuckas, yeah
I got the whole fuckin' world on my shoulders
And I got everybody breathing down my back
And I try to get high to get over
Now you can catch a nut or catch a contact
Yeah, I got the whole fuckin' world on my shoulders
And I got everybody breathing down my back
And I try to get high to get over
Bitch, you can catch a nut or catch a contact
