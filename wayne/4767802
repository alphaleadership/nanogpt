34 ContributorsMaybach Music VI (Extended) Lyrics
J.U.S.T.I.C.E League

Oh, glidin' through the city to my place (My place)
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space
(And you can still) Oh, you can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back (Maybach Music)
Oh, ah, Maybach Music
(Maybach Music)

Flows mind-blowing, these niggas switching the topic
All dick-riders, your label labeled erotic
You got a couple dollars, but really it's barely modest
Couldn't sign me if you niggas was payin' homage
Playin' both side, convicted you with verdict
Play a lil' rider, come hit you up for the murder
Chains all hollow, I peeped soon as I heard it
These niggas be talkin' shooter, but quick to send they attorney
Is it really real, like Cand Lady allure?
Money overboard, the kilos washin' ashore
Pains on the boy, Versace down to the drawers
Currency come in Crypto, you know they tapin' our calls
Chariots and lofts, niggas legs crossed
Talkin' long money, but they conversation's short
New accolades with women for me to toss
They call it "the road to riches", regardless, I had to walk
Now it's too many cars, they say I live in a bubble
But I make it the point, we poppin' all through the Summer
Got the pilots and gunners, receivers, passers and punters
My pockets playin' for keeps, G's get more than what's common
I made a few mistakes, I pray I get to repent
The passion came from the pain, I'm paintin' you all my sins
Warhol, Art Basel how it's so soft
More raw till Hov cut the 'fro off
See Rick Ross LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like
Glidin' through the city to my place (My place)
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space
(And you can still) Oh, you can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back (Maybach Music)
Oh, ah, Maybach Music

Let's go for a ride, to where your heart desire
I put your heart in drive, I'll let you borrow mine
My feet on top the clouds, I walk a thousand miles
She got them soft pussy lips, call it cottonmouth
And I'm on autopilot, got a larger closet
I'm at target practice, you at Target shoppin'
Second-hand smoke got her vision fallin' cloudy
Her eyes get so watery, them bitches started drownin'
On the ride of a lifetime
Watch out for the rats, mice, cons and the pythons
So Triple H, my God, I'm so sky high
Comin' down from the night sky, like a lightning rod
Shine like some ice, nice fives like a kite flyin'
No strings attached, we replace it with a lifeline
Out of body feelin', out our clothes and our right mind
Baby, ride me like a bumpy road to the high rise, yeah, yeah

Glidin' through the city to my place (My place)
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space
(And you can still) You can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back (Maybach Music)
Oh, ah, Maybach Music
Glidin' through the city to my place (My place)
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space
(And you can still) Oh, Maybach Music
What a hell of a year, true colors exposed
Crowns on these clowns, it's like you colored they nose
We talkin' skill set or popularity polls?
When you speak truth to power, your popularity grows
Peers switch gears out of relevance of fear
When their name's not as hot as who they wanna stand near
All you niggas weird, how can you compare
When you say you been rich but we need that shit like veneers?
For every hundred thousand dollar chain I see
On a thousandaire's neck that I dare not be
Young nigga, old nigga, you all the same to me
Just one slick tweet from trending dangerously
Rare form, airborne since Clairborne
Been fly like a runway was cleared for him
White wedding, Vogue had the exclusive
Any blemish on my past was prostitution
Sit back and let them draw their own conclusions
A picture's worth a thousand words, Mr. Houston
You wonder why cocaine's up in every song?
When music fell cocaine righted every wrong
White Ferrari Bo Derek
But the inside's black, you're standin' bow-legged
Go home and go get it
Your Miami rental cars are sleeping in my garage, motherfuckers
Glidin' through the city to my place (My place)
It feels like we're floatin up in outer space
(And you can still) You can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back (Maybach Music)
Oh, ah, Maybach Music
Glidin' through the city to my place (My place)
It feels like we're floatin up in outer space
(And you can still) Oh, Maybach Music5Embed
