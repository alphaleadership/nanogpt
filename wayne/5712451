1 ContributorStill in Love Lyrics(Intro: Lil Wayne)
It's kinda hard saying this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away
(Hook: Angelle Talerico, Lucci Lou)
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you care
Will you still be there?
Will you still be there? (Fucken right)
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you care
'cos yes I'm in love with you (Yeah)
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you care
Will you still be there?
Will you still be there?
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you care
Yes I'm in love with you
In love with you
In love (Yeah)
In love with you
In love
In love with you
In love
Yes I'm in love with you
In love with you
In love
In love with you
In love (Yeah)
In love with you (Lucci)
In love
Yes I'm in love with you (Yeah)
You might also like(Verse: Lucci Lou)
I'm bumping, playing shit with my Australian bitch (Yeah)
This coupe came with the leather
We never play the hits (No)
She say the word play clever
And I'm her favourite (What)
I'm on a whole 'nother level in this Mercedes trick
The beat banging like a baby kick (Boom)
Codeine got my voice raspy
Like I'm Jadakiss (What)
I pull her hair, smack her ass, while she takin' dick (Damn)
I disappear before she wake
She say I make her sick
By the way I go by Lucci
Drippin', draped in Gucci
Ever since a juvie
Ask a nigga that knew me
And they'll tell you the same
That boy was pushing the doochie
Proudly moving the cane
But he always stayed in his lane
Might pop pills for the prang
Let's sip a little purple rain
But not a nose or vein
A nigga must maintain
Little something for my real niggas
Don't do it for no lames
(Bridge: Lil Wayne, Lucci Lou)
Yeah (Haha)
Let's go
It's kinda hard saying this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away
(Hook: Angelle Talerico)
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you care
Will you still be there?
Will you still be there?
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you care
'cos yes I'm in love with you
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you care
Will you still be there?
Will you still be there?
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you care
Yes I'm in love with you
In love with you
In love
In love with you
In love
In love with you
In love
Yes I'm in love with you
In love with you
In love
In love with you
In love
In love with you
In love
Yes I'm in love with youEmbed
