Oh, yeah, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, brr
It's our paradise (oh) yeah (oh) and it's our war zone

Climb on board (Mula, baby)
We'll go slow and high tempo (Yeah)
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow

I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together (He the one, she the two)
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you

So we'll piss off the neighbors (Tunechi, baby)
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior (She come to the zoo)
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw (Yeah)
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone (Pop, pop, pop, pop, brr, paradise and our war zone)
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
You might also like
Pillow talk
Fucking and fighting, fucking and fighting, yeah, fuck it, if she love it, I like it, husband and wifey
We do what we do, we do how we do but we making it through
And the bedroom a zoo
We fuss for a few, then we fuck for a truce, yeah
She's something to do when there's nothing to do
We so ugly and cute, but the love is the proof
Never chucking the deuce, never coming unloose, woo
Put my tongue in her noose, out my thumb in her 'boose
Make her jump through the roof, now she touching the moon
And she love when we spoon, she gon' cum and boo-hoo
When she cummin' it's through

So we'll piss off the neighbours (Aye)
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears (Tunechi)
Yeah, reckless behavior (Mula, baby)
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on (Yeah)
It's our paradise and it's our war zone (It's our paradise)
It's our paradise and it's our war zone (Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, brrrr)

I'ma come ridin' in a foreign (Ahh)
And when I come into your city, you know that you fuckin' with me, gotta pretty me, you, you wasn't
I know that I done, been ignored (Ahh)
I know that I done been fuckin' with all of these different bitches in the city, won't you please forgive me?
Gimme a chance, oh, no, no (Ahh)

She know I be with that action when all of these actresses here
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior (Tunechi, baby)
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw (Yeah)
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone (Pop, pop, pop, pop, paradise and our war zone, yeah)
It's our paradise and it's our war zone (Pop, pop, pop, pop, brr)Embed
