It's the Sqad, oh, yeah, yeah
It's the Sqad, ya know, yeah, yeah
It's the Sqad, ya know, yeah, yeah

It's Weezy, Young Yo, and Raw Dizzy
You know who we is, you don't who we is? Then
All of yall should Sqad Up ya'self
And if you don't like it you can fuck ya'self

It feels good if I'm after him
I'm young black ass slim
I click clat at him, for practicin'
A brand new platinum whip, wit' factories rims
Bitches never smack up when they get they asses in
I'm Dizzy, hot lyrics, I spit it
Nope, I'm not kiddin', yeah, the boys is hot-rific
You might see me ridin' in Tahoes
Flyin' wit' models, sippin' on Heinkein bottles, watchin' the channels
Family thick like the Sopranos
Wit' mo' bread than McDonalds
In a whip fully dressed like systic primals
Like I'm a- you gotch yours?
Gotta have cheese like I'm nachos
I'm Dizzy, the raw-diculous, that's the shit
'Cause I been had what it takes to rip this bitch up
And anyone who fucks wit' Young Nut
Get a 12 gauge shotgun pump through ya guts, yeah
You might also like
It's Weezy and his crew, the S-Q
And we know what to do
To go and get and get the loot
Yeah, still watch how you goof around dude
'Cause the dudes still broom and move the whole room

It's Weezy, Young Yo, and Raw Dizzy
You know who we is, you don't who we is? Then
All of yall should Sqad Up ya'self
And if you don't like it you can fuck ya'self
It's Weezy, ya know, and Raw Dizzy
You know who we is, you don't who we is? Then
All of yall should Sqad Up ya'self
And if you don't like it you can fuck ya'self

Yo, you know, stupid hoe
No I ain't cha daddy bitch
Niggas sittin' in the Caddy bitch
And you better have my dough when you get at me bitch
Young Y-O, the boy is back
Bitch like Too Short, I was born to mac
With the throwback jersey, wit' the fitted to the back
20's on the coupe, man, I did it like that (He did it like that?)
I'll do it again
Good pussy make paper, the dude a pimp
I'm a player to the heart, dank to the head
Straight to the bed, do it straight to the head
S -Q-A- to the D 'til I'm dead
Been lookin' for a pimp, bitch holla at red
Heard what I said? Open up ya legs
And make Weezy money spread
It's Weezy, Young Yo, and Raw Dizzy
You know who we is, you don't who we is? Then
All of yall should Sqad Up ya'self
And if you don't like it you can fuck ya'self
It's Weezy, ya know, and Raw Dizzy
You know who we is, you don't who we is? Then
All of yall should Sqad Up ya'self
And if you don't like it you can fuck ya'self

Big 20's on the whip look slick
Leather seats, tele-v's, extra keys
My brotha fee-fee probably out wit' cha chick
And bring her home if her mouth game sick
Don't get me wrong I'm the don of the click
A Hot Boy, I stand alone in this bitch
My Glock toy all chrome, click, click
Sqad wit' a chick
Check my tires as I ride by ya quick
Check my air hole tech
Make me give ya ass a air hole neck
And we only fuck wit ya girl for that hoe neck
Guess what, Sqad Up, baby, that's up next
Cash Money, lil' Whizzle, off glass, 500 Degreez
Young Money, Money Young is a team
And the money ain't as young as it seem, dollas comin'
S-Q, Weezy, holla, I'm comin'
It's Weezy, Young Yo, and Raw Dizzy
You know who we is, you don't who we is? Then
All of yall should Sqad Up ya'self
And if you don't like it you can fuck ya'self
It's Weezy, Young Yo, and Raw Dizzy
You know who we is, you don't who we is? Then
All of yall should Sqad Up ya'self
And if you don't like it you can fuck ya'self
It's Weezy, Young Yo, and Raw Dizzy
You know who we is, you don't who we is? Then
All of yall should Sqad Up ya'self
And if you don't like it you can fuck ya'selfEmbed
