All night long I wait
Yeah, hey mama

Kick him out the bed, I'm comin' over
Got something to show ya
Behold ya eyes, I's wanna hold ya
Just hold ya tight like a four-leaf clover
I be goin' through your flowers, baby, your garden's open
A sight for sore eyes, good Lord I'm focused
Can hardly notice anything other
Than the woman with the face of my future baby mother
Tell 'em

I'm a big man, she's a big girl
Put on them heels and put on that skirt
She wants to get naughty, we can get bad
She's a good girl with the good girl dance
I'm ice cream, she's a hot swirl
We can get married and live in our world
Let's play rough, we can get wild
I can go home but I'll stay, cheat but I want you

So I go by Weezy, love me or leave me
I hate to leave her, I think I need her
She's such a teaser, such a diva
We can park right here, baby, fuck the meter
Throw it to me, baby, I can be ya receiver
Call me in the last minute, I can be ya reliever
Call me at the last minute, I be there even
Late night, early morning or maybe this evening
You might also like
She ain't no stunt, she ain't no filly
I wanna get mad, but then not really
She's so fly, I could get mine
But I do it much better with her by my side
Love is alright, we gon' get blitzed tonight
All my girls wanna make that money
All my thugs wanna take that money
All night long I'ma milk that honey so

All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait to tear you to pieces
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait (All night long I wait for you, girl, all night long)

All night long I wait, to see you, babe
And watch the sun rise in your face
All night long I wait for you to play
And let my open arms take you away

She say she wanna be the one I get next to, yes boo
Let's do that, who that? You that
The one I wanna get next to, let's move
Get you to the crib, now I see you
As the one I wanna give sex to, sex you
Sexy you, you sexy devil, you
Angel, lookin' like ya single
Thank you, have yourself a drink
I drink too, saw you when I came through
Nah, can't do, nothin' if it ain't you
It's Wayne boo, I don't do what them lames do
I come at you from a whole other angle
Now one time for the ladies in the high skirts
Two times for the ladies in the tight jeans
Three times for the ladies who ain't got no panties on
Let's go home
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait to tear you to pieces
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait (All night long I wait for you, girl, all night long)
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait to tear you to pieces
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait (All night long I wait for you, girl, all night long)

All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait (All night long I wait for you, girl, all night long)
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait (All night long I wait for you, girl, all night long)Embed
