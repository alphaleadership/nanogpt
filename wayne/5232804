Got the game fucked up
Everybody in this fuckin' game got the game fucked up
Trippin', work man, work
Fuck you 'gon be on the streets talkin' bout what you do for a living
And you ain't doing it?
Fuck you 'gon be in the club looking like you do something, and you don't really do it
Fuck you 'gon stand next to a nigga like me, that really do it, and you don't do it?
Get the fuck from by me man!
You feel me, I got a beautiful bitch next to me
Nigga all up on my fucking shoulder talkin' bout 'nigga!'
Man, get the fuck off me man, write a rap man
Go eat- go make a beat or somethin'
You niggas looking hungry, better eat you somethin'You might also likeEmbed
