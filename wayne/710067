10 ContributorsYa Ya Ya Lyrics
Oh, no, the fight's out, somebody's about to get they lights knocked out (Music)
Yeah (Yeah)
A little opera for ya (Uh-huh, Weezy, Weezy)
The Capricorn (Uh-huh, Cash Money)
Nivea (Jive)
Uh, what? (Kelly I see ya daddy, Miss Nivea)

Front with me like you's a real baller
And I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
With that other chicken trying to make me jealous
And I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
Getting all salty 'cause I'm hanging out
Girl, I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
All them loud words coming out your mouth
Boy, I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya

Straight up at the ATL
Where them pimps and them ballers and them hustlers dwell
I met a fly guy then we switched the cells
Under the influence
So I could hardly tell
If he was the one for me
Papi doing this, papi doing that
Big thangs under the Cadillac
I'm tight, thoroughbred, spread it like butter
Walk through the club (niggas) be like, "What the"
Shawty throwing money at me like he's a pitcher
Maybe on the weekend or something, I get witcha
We did the damn thang, and it was all crazy
Now you want to call me up like I'm your lady
You might also like
Front with me like you's a real baller
And I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
With that other chicken trying to make me jealous
And I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
Getting all salty 'cause I'm hanging out
Girl, I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
All them loud words coming out your mouth
Boy, I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya

Hey ladies, what's the word?
Some of these cats got a lot of nerve
Tryna run game, but I'm 'bout to serve
Gotta have dough 'cause I love to splurge, Gucci and Fendi
Come scoop me up on your motorcycle
But once we get alone then you can rock the result
And if you promise to treat me right
Boy, I guarantee, I keep this thing locked tight
You thugged out with a lot of loot, uh-huh
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you, uh-huh
But I'm not gon' let you break the rules
What you did to get it, you need to do to keep it

Front with me like you's a real baller
And I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
With that other chicken trying to make me jealous
And I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
Getting all salty 'cause I'm hanging out
Girl, I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
All them loud words coming out your mouth
Boy, I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
Hey, can you feel the brand new day? (Woo)
All my superstars came out to play (Woo)
To see the thug child from around the way (Woo)
This type of thing happens like every day

(Yo, Weezy 'bout it)
I keep it real and intensive
Me no speak ya, ya 'cause my grill is expensive
Don't mean to be offensive
I know you probably run across a bunch of scrubs with disfunctioned tongues
All in your mug talk a whole bunch umm
But I'm me, I just want your love
Me, I'm bunch of thug
Big heart, but punctured some
But I'm tryna patch it up with a bunch of hugs
For real, I ain't just talking whatever, Mami
We could get together and make a bunch of us
And I know a bunch of girls create a bunch of fuss
Over young Weez, but I'm getting at Niv, holla
Don't bother me with your yada
I'm good with little mama, and she good with big papa
I'm hood and she real proper
ATL Shorty and New Orleans Don Dada
Anything else is ya, ya, ya
Front with me like you's a real baller
And I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
With that other chicken trying to make me jealous
And I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
Getting all salty 'cause I'm hanging out
Girl, I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
All them loud words coming out your mouth
Boy, I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
Front with me like you's a real baller
And I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
With that other chicken trying to make me jealous
And I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
Getting all salty 'cause I'm hanging out
Girl, I be like yeah, ya, ya, ya
All them loud words coming out your mouth
Boy, I be like yeah, ya, ya, yaEmbed
