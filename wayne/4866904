8 ContributorsStick ’Em Lyrics
Man, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
We done came this far, I'm so proud of my niggas
Every house I got came with a lounge for my niggas
I make mountain tops fall to the ground for my niggas
Hit your town with my niggas, shut it down with my niggas
We fucked the same bitch, that's a pound with my nigga
I'ma let my nigga shine, I'ma let my nigga shine
And if you ain't my nigga, you a cloud to a nigga

Man, I'll cop a key before a plea my brother
Break it down and sell it just to feed my brother
Guerrilla warfare, bitch, I feel like King Kong
Got the world in my hands like a screaming white woman
Dad, why the fuck did you leave my mother?
Rich as a motherfucker, me and my mother
Can't trust her, can't trust her if she ain't my mother
Can't believe these hoes, can't believe it's not butter
Can't believe these niggas, can't believe they're 100
Can't believe the drugs pills, can't believe it's not cut
Can't believe it's real love, can't believe it's not lust
Love is blind, love is blind, with his eyes wide shut
I ain't lyin', you gon' get your bitch kidnapped
You don't answer the phone, you gon' get your bitch whacked
In exchange for yourself, you can get your bitch back
Love is blind, love is blind, 'cause my heart is pitch black
Think fast, blam back, bullets fast, Amtrak
Get your shit ramshacked, get my bitch man jacked
I'm too high to backtrack, it's too good to pass back
Shoutout to the weed man, never sold a bad pack
I'm just sticking to the code, I ain't tryna crack that
Actin' bad on these boys like a bitch with bad cramps
And somebody said "hell" and I caught a flashback
Of that one-man cell, then I had to snap back
You might also like
Like fuck that shit, my nigga, you around all your niggas, around all your niggas
With a Nubian queen, skin brown as the liqueur, brown as the liqueur
And the brand new machine coming down like a missile, coming down like a missile
Brand new machine gun, brrrrr stick em', brrrr stick em'

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
The money look so beautiful walking up the aisle to a nigga
Tryna figure how an empty background become a crowd full of niggas
And the bitch right next to me feel like she miles from a nigga, at least we all smile for the picture

Them niggas that's been there, them niggas my niggas
I need 'em to bring me more rounds for my niggas
We up, I don't have to look down for my niggas
I paid dues, show the amounts to them niggas
She told me she'll only go down on her nigga
And then she looked up with a mouthful of niggas
Doubt that I'll ever be doubtful my nigga
My stamp on the game, send it out to them niggas
I wanna be like Lil Wayne when I grows up
Smile full of bling-bling when I blows up
I overtalked for what they did to the code crush
Fuck the man, now he owes us, fuck the man
Couldn't pass, had to come up with another plan
Couldn't ball 'cause I couldn't dribble with my other hand
Fuck the man, no really girl, fuck the man
I'm the man, I don't give a fuck about another man
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
I'm the man, I don't give a fuck about another man
Brand new machine coming down like a missile, down like a missile
Brand new machine gun, brrrrr stick em', brrrr stick em'3Embed
