Ohhh! (KE on the Track)
Ohhh! (Bobby V, Young Mula Baby!)

She want me, I want her
I'm looking in the mirror at all her curves like
Ooh oh, in the mirror like (Like, like, like)
Ooh oh, in the mirror like
She on me and I'm on her
Posin' in the mirror doin' things to her like
Ooh oh, in the mirror like
Ooh oh, in the mirror like

In the mirror, in the mirror like
In the mirror, in the mirror like
In the mirror, in the mirror like
In the mirror, in the mirror like

Ooh, she got a thing for the nasty
Yeah, she do anything you ask her
We all up in my crib, straight from the club
There's a mirror on the ceiling, right above my tub
Yeah, shawty downin' me
Lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets
I like to look it up, that's when we do our thing
D-D-Do you see what I see?
You might also like
Tied up, I'm 'bout to take you down
And yes I'm that man in the mirror
Your reflection's so sexy
I guess I gotta make it clearer
And I know that

She want me, I want her (Oh!)
I'm looking in the mirror at all her curves like
Ooh oh, in the mirror like
Ooh oh, in the mirror like
She on me and I'm on her
Posin' in the mirror doin' things to her like
Ooh oh, in the mirror like
Ooh oh, in the mirror like

In the mirror, in the mirror like
In the mirror, in the mirror like
In the mirror, in the mirror like
In the mirror, in the mirror like

Yeah, put your hands on the glass
That thang a little big, turn around real fast
Sweatin' up in here, we steamin' up the room
I can't see your reflection, but I know what to do
Do you like this, do you like that
Turn you 'round front, flip you on your back
Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?
Tied up, I'm 'bout to take you down
And yes I'm that man in the mirror
Your reflection's so sexy
I guess I gotta make it clearer
And I know that

She want me, I want her (Oooh!)
I'm looking in the mirror at all her curves like
Ooh oh, in the mirror like (Oooh!)
Ooh oh, in the mirror like (Oooh!)
She on me and I'm on her
Posin' in the mirror doin' things to her like (Yeah)
Ooh oh, in the mirror like (Like a mirror, I see me)
Ooh oh, in the mirror like (Wow!)

Yeah, like a mirror, I see you
Uh, mirror mirror on the wall
I'm lookin' for love, I'm lookin' for love
And if your mirror crack, I'm hooked on your drugs
Buzz buzz buzz, I'm a love bug, yeah
Purple rain she look like Apollonia
She smell like bath and body and begonias
And me I smell like California
Because I smoke marijuana whenever Mary wanna
I think her name's Stephanie, but call her Steph
Shawty so right I don't know what's left
Who your daddy? Then I hit it faster
The mirror said you are you conceited bastard
She want me, I want her
I'm looking in the mirror at all her curves like (Tunechi)
Ooh oh, in the mirror like (Ha! Bobby V!)
Ooh oh, in the mirror like
She on me and I'm on her (Wow!)
Posin' in the mirror doin' things to her like
Ooh oh, in the mirror like (Like, like, like, like)
Ooh oh, in the mirror like (Like, like, like, like)

In the mirror, in the mirror like
In the mirror, in the mirror like
In the mirror, in the mirror like
In the mirror, in the mirror like

Like a mirror up in it, I could see me in it
Like a mirror up in it, I could see me in it
Like a mirror up in it, I could see me in it
Like a mirror up in it, Hehe!

Yeah, like a mirror up in it Ohhh!
For lookin' in that mirror
Then what you probably see
Is Lil' Tunechi, & Bobby V
Yeah! Ohhh!
Ohhhh! Ohhhh!
Yeah! Ohhh!
