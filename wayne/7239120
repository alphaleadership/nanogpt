Pull up to the house in somethin' you can't pronounce
All of my chains is out
Foreign lil' bitch, I'm learnin' her language now
I know what her name is now
But that ain't important, if he ain't gang we extort him
I keep my brain in my quota
I do the dash, I won't see flames from the motor
Stay in your lane or get over
Beep, beep, beep, beep, all of these bags, I'm a hoarder
All of this Actavis movin' as fast as a tortoise
Been ballin' since way back, back, back
Me and Lil' Rich, we been ballin' since Nash and Amar'e
I treat the cash like it's garbage
The greener the grass in the garden, I'm plantin' a forest
Red as the ants in the army
Your bitch gon' get F'd likе a test, she got class in the mornin'
Moonwalk, lеt the juice talk
Got sticks, got racks, no pool balls
Don't think I won't shoot 'cause I'm a superstar
I can shoot for the stars, hit a shootin' star
I can walk it like I talk it with my shoes off
Soft chinchilla in the villa, that's too hard
Fuckin' on a lil' bitch, said her boyfriend a crip, cut her off
Think she tried to give me blue balls
Cheek, cheek, turn one booty, cheek, cheek, turn one booty
Cheek, cheek, turn both booty cheeks, they go boom, bong
I got one hoe with me, she got somethin' for me
Let me take off this red and get blew on

Oh lord, oh lord, she said, "I got ahead," she gon' blow off
Headshot, headshot, that tongue put my dick in a headlock, mm
Oh lord, oh lord, she said, "I got ahead," she gon' blow off
Headshot, headshot, that tongue put my dick in a headlock, mm
That tongue put my dick in a headlock
She gave me some neck, stuck her neck out
I open her legs and she stretch down
She lay in the bed and it's wet now
She talk all that heat and she melt down
I gave the drill and it helped out
I gave her the D and she fell out
Put some ice on her finger, she chilled out (Big CEO)

You rappin' that shit that you ain't about (Woo)
They really do anything for the clout (Clout)
His daddy a rat, he a mini mouse (Ha)
Ain't chasin' no bitches, we pick 'em out
These niggas be lame, please do not speak on my name
Show her fifteen minutes of the fame
Got a young nigga die for the chain (Chain)
Buy a Cuban like, have 'em knock out your brain
She wanna have a trust fund, baby
Open up wide, girl, just take some
I ain't gotta say nothin', she gon' just get naked
Young nigga really rich, nah, I ain't just fakin' (Haa)
Fuck is they talkin' 'bout? (Yeah)
Why they hatin' on me 'cause I made it out? (Yeah)
Ain't fightin', been walkin' with hella knots (Yeah)
Took the Chrome Hearts and I made it hot
They really owe me a big, big, big check (Yeah)
I put it on and it's gone 'cause I trend-set (Yeah)
Hop in lane, might set my 'Vette (Err)
And go buy some shit that you can't get (Bitch)
I was proud of myself, bought the Prada fit
I don't need no deal with a profit spit
Why you play with the gang? Got a first-aid kit
Why he brought his hoe 'round? Now the bitch get hit, yeah
I ain't really worried 'bout shit
My baby mama bad and my bank account lit
Ran up the money, I ain't ask for shit
My son need the Pampers, I couldn't quit
Now I just might go and buy a Mercedes
Back-to-back, me and Tunechi got em' starin'
Don't call my phone, no clearance
I need a quarter mill for an appearance, bitch
Oh lord, oh lord, she said, "I got ahead," she gon' blow off
Headshot, headshot, that tongue put my dick in a headlock, mm
Oh lord, oh lord, she said, "I got ahead," she gon' blow off
Headshot, headshot, that tongue put my dick in a headlock, mm
That tongue put my dick in a headlock
She gave me some neck, stuck her neck out
I open her legs and she stretch down
She lay in the bed and it's wet now
She talk all that heat and she melt down
I gave the drill and it helped out
I gave her the D and she fell out
Put some ice on her finger, she chilled out
Oh lord, oh lord, she said, "I got ahead," she gon' blow off
Headshot, headshot, that tongue put my dick in a headlock, mm1Embed
