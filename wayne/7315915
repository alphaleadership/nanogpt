It's another one
Mr. Beatz production
Forecast

I'm outta my mind, I'm floating freely
Means I got no time for tying down
I love the night time, but just to party
So hang up, nice try, I'll see you 'round

Before you go and start making plans to be my man
Understand that I'm not easy to do
But if you think you got a good chance then try your hand
Go and make your mark, baby
Come and shoot me

Can you catch me, baby?
 make you crazy
Can you catch me?
You can't catch me, baby
I'm a moving target
Can you catch me, baby?
Want me to be your lady
Can you catch me?
You can't catch me, baby
I'm a moving target
You might also like
Stop before it started
'Cause boy you're gonna end up broken-hearted
You better put out that flamе that's sparking
You're never gonna catch up to a moving targеt

Yeah, love is for fools
Rules are for tools
I live on battlefront
I'm making moves

Before you go and start making plans to be my man
Understand that I'm not easy to do
But if you think you got a good chance then try your hand
Go and make your mark, baby
Come and shoot me

Can you catch me, baby?
 make you crazy
Can you catch me?
You can't catch me, baby
I'm a moving target
Can you catch me, baby?
Want me to be your lady
Can you catch me?
You can't catch me, baby
I'm a moving target
Moving target (You won't catch up to me)
A moving target (You can't catch up to me)
A moving target (You won't catch up to me)
A moving target (You can't catch up)
Stop before it started
'Cause boy you're gonna end up broken-hearted
You better put out that flame that's sparking
You're never gonna catch up to a moving target

We are not the same, I am a Martian
I got the aim, you are the target, yeah
Get  harder than the hardest
I got more paper than the office
Okay, Ashley if your boyfriend is hot then I am acid
He can take you to his mansion but I can take you to my planet
Let me invade that thang
And I'ma make it mine like I need that thang
And I'ma take my time, I'ma lay-back man
Give me head, I give you head back, same

Can you catch me, baby?
 make you crazy
Can you catch me?
You can't catch me, baby
I'm a moving target
Can you catch me, baby?
Want me to be your lady
Can you catch me?
You can't catch me, baby
I'm a moving target
Can you catch me, baby?
 make you crazy
Can you catch me?
You can't catch me, baby
I'm a moving target
Can you catch me, baby?
Want me to be your lady
Can you catch me?
You can't catch me, baby
I'm a moving target

Stop before it started
'Cause boy you gonna end up broken-hearted
You better put out the flame that's sparking
You're never gonna catch up to a moving targetEmbed
