3 ContributorsWild Life... Lyrics
I was in this situation
Every night a new lituation
Every convo is the same
You just trying to get situated

Oh, you from Vegas
Do you live a wild life?
I'm in my zone
Come be in my time
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

I don't
Want to ruin our exchange
Running in this rain
In a rush to be claimed
Taking trust to the bank, oh
You have words for me
And you demonstrate through body language
We don't really say shit but we conversate

So wild (Yeah)
You so wild (Ooh, wild)
Oh, you live a wild life (Oh, oh)
Oh, you live a wild life, wild life
You might also like
You can't love me, that's a bet
Can't get in my head
Open up your mouth, ooh, ooh
Making rash decisions now
Wе had the DJs before wе had the club
Move to the crib before somebody shot it up, ayy
I was a youngin, not turnt down
Now I'm grew'd up
I talk nice to it, pay my respects (Ooh, woah)
I call you wild but it's really me acting out
Projecting like a cinema (Ooh, woah)
Projecting, I'm making a movie, yeah

I'm so wild
Ooh, I'm so
I'm so, yeah
I'm so wild
Ooh, I'm so
Let's get it, ayy

Girl
Get it, get it, girl (Let's get, let's get wild)
Girl
Get it (Only for tonight)
I can't tell you much about the DJs because they were always shooting
But it was always packed, I don't knowEmbed
