1 ContributorGod Did LyricsSharp
I done did
Yeah, whattt
Yo !
Wooo..
Nigga i done did
(God Did)
Bruh!
Almost signed a contract, was a done deal
Daddy said “be careful with the pen”
Boy you gotta look deep, so you will never sign a dumb deal
My shots filled with gin, tell my spirit “lemme please”
Down to my stomach, i just pray my daddy Rest in Peace
Got enough recipes ? Now I’m cooking all these niggas
Game is chess, now watch me get the piece !
And those nights that i was scared to piss?
Cos in that dark, you don’t see light.. but i was wrong cos im the light.. nigga
And now niggas wanna dare to piss
Trust me i call the shots… and nahh I’ll never darе to miss
Lost my goggles, they said maybe hе was septic
I wanna believe shit is real, but nah im just a little skeptic
Life taking it so hard, ain’t no doubts it truly sucks
My demons ain’t left me
They in the corner of my room doing drugs
You might also likeI think about the times i was naive and shit
They said we’d never make it even if we bang the streets
Last nigga in front of my face, man i banged his teeth
Too many talks, Maroni bout to spit !!
Had to spill it
How do we grow, they all are users, no they never paid us
They shut us down and made us bow, they always underrate us
I break the spell, fuck the niggas.. all the shitty invaders
But I’m a rebel, tryna put my hommies on the radars-soon they’ll rate us
Yeah
Still God did
God did
God did
God really did
God is doing
God will do
Welcome To Milan
Ko ma po l’eti yin pe ko ni da fun eni ti o ni da fun
God did, God will still doEmbed
