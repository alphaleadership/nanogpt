5 ContributorsThinking Bout You Lyrics
When I jumped in, I had no key
20 chains around my neck, just so they notice me
I had to grow into the man I was supposed to be
Pockets fatter than Professor Ogaby
Professor Twizzy, I'm cooking up a quarter key
Got white bitches snorting Coca off the Coca leaf
They snorting Coke off my chest, snort it off the D
And she just told me how I be all in her oaveries
How she just wanna be on the road and on the tour with me
Started out on the bed, then on the floor with me
She rub her hands through my hair, then she got ahold of me
Then I'm falling in love, it's something new for me

Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Everyday, I been thinking bout you
Thinking bout you, I can't stop thinking bout you
Shit, I can't stop thinking bout you
Can't get you off my mind, stripping you with my eyes
Fucking you in my head
Thinking bout you

I been sippin’ syrup, I been takin’ xannies
That's why I ain't worried ‘bout your baby daddy
He so unromantic, I'm so understanding
He don't take you serious, he take advantage
But I been sippin’ syrup, I been takin’ addies
On my own world, on another planet
You deserve the world, and a fucking grammy
So get up and thank the lord and your fuckin’ family
Yeah, let me roll somethin’, the molly got her sweatin’, cocoa got her nose runnin’
Her body rockin’ that way, ‘bout blow something
I'm just thinking ‘bout you, about your loving
You might also like
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Everyday, I been thinking bout you
Thinking bout you, I can't stop thinking bout you
Shit, I can't stop thinking bout you
Can't get you off my mind, stripping you with my eyes
Fucking you in my head
Thinking bout you

Ah-ah-ahh
Used to be, when I saw you in town
I would greet you with a smile
But from you all I’d get was a frown
But, things have changed, like a revolution baby
We talk on the phone without a fight, I think I found a solution
I’ve heard before, good things could come to those who wait
But if you think right now’s not a good time, don’t you worry because I’ll just wait
Thinkin’ about you girl
