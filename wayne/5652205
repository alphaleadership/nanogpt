16 ContributorsPut In Work Lyrics
XL Eagle made it
OG Parker

She got humps and a bump
Junk in the trunk
Back that ass up, feel up on it like beep-beep
Girl, take it off, go a little bit harder
Fuckin' with the lights off, leavin' on the TV
Gettin' me started, lickin' on your body
Tellin' me not to say nothin', when you wanna see me?

Alright, alright, my lips are sealed
Baby, you gotta put in work
You gotta put in work, work, work
If you want me to put you first, yeah
Put that pussy on me, what I deserve
You gotta put in work

Panties on the floor, we don't need clothes
Can I get a repeat of the show?
Young Jacquees in your sheets
Bumpin' that CB, ride it slow
Goin' nine-to-five (Five), but you put in work (Work)
Ooh, let me put it in drive (Drive)
All gas when I'm in that skirt (Skirt, yeah), yeah
Peakin' on your phone, tell your friends, "Call back"
When you leave to go home, turn around, come back
Silk sheets on the bed
I know you just got your hair done and it's late
Don't be scared, I'll get it redone, lil' bae, you know I'm paid
You come first (Woah, yeah)
And that's with sex and life, whatever works (Oh-woah, yeah)
I'll rip your bra off, you'll rip off my shirt (Yeah)
You mine as soon as you step on my turf
I beat it like it's percussion, come let me put in work
You might also like
She got humps and a bump
Junk in the trunk
Back that ass up, feel up on it like beep-beep (Oh, oh, oh)
Girl, take it off, go a little bit harder
Fuckin' with the lights off, leavin' on the TV (Yeah)
Gettin' me started, lickin' on your body (Oh)
Tellin' me not to say nothin', when you wanna see me?

Alright, alright, my lips are sealed (Oh)
Baby, you gotta put in work (Put in work)
You gotta put in work, work, work (Oh)
If you want me to put you first (Put you first), yeah
Put that pussy on me, what I deserve
You gotta put in work

You keep callin' me over
Hope you not with the games, let you off, it's all over
Late nights, I'm never sober, yeah
Hold my car, call an Uber, I don't wanna drive, yeah
I've been OD'ing
Your body's what I'm missin'
You bad and you know it
And I'ma need you to show it, show it
Show it, show it, show—
Are you ready for me now?
And ride around on this merry-go-round
Baby, let's make it official
She got humps and a bump
Junk in the trunk
Back that ass up, feel up on it like beep-beep (Oh, oh, oh)
Girl, take it off, go a little bit harder (Yeah)
Fuckin' with the lights off, leavin' on the TV (Yeah)
Gettin' me started, lickin' on your body (Yeah)
Tellin' me not to say nothin', when you wanna see me? (Ooh-ooh, ooh)

Alright, alright, my lips are sealed
Baby, you gotta put in work (Yeah, put in work)
You gotta put in work, work, work (Yeah, yeah)
If you want me to put you first (To put you first), yeah
Put that pussy on me, what I deserve
You gotta put in work

Oh-oh, put in work for me (Ooh, yeah, I want it)
Baby, do your thing, and put in work for me all night, yeah (All night, yeah, yeah)
I wanna finish slowly, oh, oh, baby (Oh, oh, baby)
You gotta put in work3Embed
