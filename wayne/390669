8 ContributorsThis Is What Rock n Roll Looks Like Lyrics
Hey, hey, hey, if you're ready to rage
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wearing leather and lace
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like

Umm, microphone check one, two
Yeah, yeah, it's Porcelain, baby
And this is what rock and roll looks like

The dark days falling down on my skin
I feel the thirst to get it in
Trouble, trouble, drink it down
Like a king, I'll take the crown
Flush away the pain 'til my head spins

'Cause we're the kids that belong to the night
We gonna get pissed, we gonna start a fight

Hey, hey, hey, if you're ready to rage
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wearing leather and lace
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-now, na-now (Hey)

We're putting dark shades on for the cameras
Take a picture now if you wanna have us
Lipstick smeared across my face
Not a drop will go to waste
Baby, the beast is yours to chase

'Cause we're the kids that belong to the night
We gonna get pissed, we gonna start a fight

Hey, hey, hey, if you're ready to rage
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wearing leather and lace
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like

I-I-I-I need a cigarette and a bad bitch
Come be my soccer ball and get yo ass kicked
I like my pizza cold, I like my glass full
I don't like bullshit, but I like Red Bull
I smell like Guns N' Roses
I look like money, bitch
I taste like rock n' roll
I make her lick her lips
And all the drama's dead
I'm in the past life
I forgot her name, but I remember last night
You can do what you do
I done did enough
I'm on that gangsta shit
I don't give a fuck, Weezy

You wanna talk the talk, get up and show me your walk (Hey)
You wanna talk the talk, you better show me your walk (Hey, hey, hey)
You wanna talk the talk, get up and show me your walk (Hey)
You wanna talk the talk, you better show me your walk

Hey, hey, hey, if you're ready to rage
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wearing leather and lace
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like
Hey, hey, hey, if you're ready to rage
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wearing leather and lace
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like
