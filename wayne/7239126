16 ContributorsShh Lyrics
Aye, trust fund, trust fund, trust fund
I get my money by lump sums
I get the check and I go dumb (Go dumb)
Rack in the money got threesomes
Bitch I'm a problem, literally (Literally)
I'm back in my bag, you kidding me?
I bought her a bag from Italy (Italy)
That money we gettin' infinity

Nigga be rappin' cappin' (Cappin')
I thought you was rich, what happened? (What happened?)
More sticks in the trap, no lackin'
More shows too much on a backend (Backend)
Bitch I'm big boss, call me CEO
Had my hitter pull up like a Dominoes
Had to give me the brain like an honor roll
Got a bank roll, but it never fold
I was freezin' freezin' like an eskimo
I ain't signed a deal, not to Alamo (Alamo)
Bitch I'm rich forever, so I'm never broke (Never)
Me and Tunechi, that's a double goat
Sippin' on clean, clean (Clean)
In her mouth like Listerine (Rine)
I woke up and I bought a ring (Ring)
You broke, then don't say a thing (Broke)
You might also like
Trust fund, trust fund, trust fund
Suck me 'til your tongue numb
Fuck her 'til she numb numb
Countin' 'til my thumbs numb
Put that on my unborn
Skatin' with my gun showin'
She tell me how her day goin'
I tell her where my nut goin'
Rich and Tune
If they salty throw it in the wound
Plenty goons, shooter shootin' like Benny Boom
Bitches new
On a yacht, somewhere in Tulum
In her womb, in her mouth like a silver spoon
I'm back in my bag, you kiddin' me?
This gun in my bag artillery
I move the bag left by Hilary
Got suicide doors I'm killin' me
I bought my bitch a ring
You hoes are only a fling
I sold your hoe a dream
You broke, then don't say a thing

Shh
Money talk nigga
If you broke, shut up like we playin' golf nigga
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Money talk nigga
If you broke, shut up, better not even cough nigga
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Money talk nigga
I been drippin' on your bitch, wipe her off nigga

Money talk nigga
If you broke, shut up like we playin' golf nigga
Aye, trust fund, trust fund, trust fund
I get my money by lump sums
I get the check and I go dumb
Rack in the money got threesomes
Bitch I'm a problem, literally
I'm back in my bag, you kidding me?
I bought her a bag from Italy
That money we gettin' infinity

Trust fund, trust fund, trust fund
Suck me 'til your tongue numb
Fuck her 'til she numb numb
Countin' 'til my thumbs numb
I'm back in my bag, you kiddin' me?
This gun in my bag artillery
I move the bag left by Hilary
Got suicide doors I'm killin' me

Trust fund, trust fund, trust fund
I get my money by lump sums
I get the check and I go dumb
Rack in the money got threesomes
Bitch I'm a problem, literally (Literally)
I'm back in my bag, you kidding me?
I bought her a bag from Italy (Italy)
That money we gettin' infinity
