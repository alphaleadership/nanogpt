4 ContributorsPineapple Sunkiss (Laced Up) Lyrics
Yes
Pineapple Sunkiss, baby
Laced up
Uh-huh

Yeah, all these hoes ain't nothin' but hoes
I got a few college bitches and a couple of pros
I cut 'em like cards, I just shuffle and fold
Got so many on my bag that my duffle is swole, woah
I like them sweet southern country hoes
I don't care about them east coast grumpy hoes
And my west coast girl got her own condo
Got me 'bout to buy a crib by the Hollywood O, oh
It's -
That nigga they be checkin' for
I'm prolly gettin' head, from a bitch I never met before
Perfеctly protected though, Magnum's my weapon, hoе
Bah, Bah, Bah, Bah, Bah, Bah, Bah, Bah, Bah, die slow

Now shake, bounce, toss that ass like rover
Rock the boat, don't tip the boat over
All these house tryna play that roll
But I wrote the script baby, let's start the show
I said shake, bounce, toss that ass like rover
Rock the boat don't tip the boat over
All these house tryna play that roll
But I wrote the script baby let's start the show

Miss -
Fat pussy, how you doing? Where you going?
Where you from? Can I come?
Can a nigga get a turn? Then -
Like Usher let it burn, like a perm
Say she got some good brain
I say well shit I need to learn
See I straight hit the block like Big Worm
Jiffy peanut butter seats, softer than Lubriderm, hoe, haha
See that's how the shit go
Damn it feel good to tell a bitch no
Me, I let a bitch know, straight from the door
No dope just dick bitch, kick snow
Then what happens after all was said
I was getting some head
Get-Getting some head

Now shake, bounce, toss that ass like rover
Rock the boat, don't tip the boat over
All these house tryna play that roll
But I wrote the script baby, let's start the show
I said shake, bounce, toss that ass like rover
Rock the boat don't tip the boat over
All these house tryna play that roll
But I wrote the script baby let's start the show
It's like everywhere I'm is-a and everywhere I go
Curren$y is known for running through these pretty hoes
And it's easy to do, because nigga been told
Put me up on the game when I step through the doors
Ohh I, dammit, I'm so quick
Slow flow, but the game will run a circle 'round a bitch
Shawty got a 9-5, I bet you I could make her quit
Now her man mad at her cause he found out that she strip, ha
This one chick that I had from the 7th Ward
Red bone with two gold teeth, from out the St. Bernard Projects
I slept, 'cause shawty used to break it off
She had two sons, I used to buy them lil' racing cars
But I'm a dog, so you know it didn't last
Gotta keep 100 bitches in and out they back to back
'Cause pimpin' ain't easy but it gotta be done
By Curren$y, the Hot Spitta and the Birdman's son

Now shake, bounce, toss that ass like rover
Rock the boat, don't tip the boat over
All these house tryna play that roll
But I wrote the script baby, let's start the show
I said shake, bounce, toss that ass like rover
Rock the boat don't tip the boat over
All these house tryna play that roll
But I wrote the script baby let's start the showEmbed
