1 ContributorCLPN LyricsBiomolecules! , produced by the living
Like , Carbohydrates made up of the monomers monosaccharides, main source of short term energy
Like, Lipids made up of the monomers glycerol and fatty acids,  stored fats and oils
You need to have C-C or C-H
Proteins, made up of monomers called amino acids, speeds everything up
And nucleic acids made up of nucleotides, store and read the genetic code
You can stay there, and I'm sure you will learn
Many thing you may not have known
It's fun to learn the CLPN
It's fun to learn the CLPN
They are needed for life!
They -  are - im-por-tant
It's fun to learn the CLPN!
It's fun to learn the CLPN
You can get yourself some carbon!, its essential to life!
You can have polymers when you combine monomers!
Young man, are you listening to me?
Polymers of monosaccharides are called polysaccharides
Polymers of glycerides are called triglycerides 
But you got to know this one thing
The polymer of proteins is called a polypeptide!
And lastly, the polymer of nucleic acids are called polynucleotides!
And just learn it, the CLPN!You might also likeEmbed
