10 ContributorsI Donâ€™t Need Her Lyrics
I Am Not A Human Being
Part 2, Check me out

Yeah, Uh
I fell in love with a pedestrian
'Cause she walked right over me
I should run over that bitch at a crosswalk
In my new Mercedes, I forgot to dance when she played me like a ukelele
Huh, just another sad love song
Like Toni Braxton, should've played you like a saxophone
At least we coulda made music, instead of trippin'
I bought the bitch a dozen roses with eleven missin'
Huh, she said she wanna be a lifeguard
Bitch, you can't even save yourself, fuck you talkin' 'bout?
Huh, I park my dick up in her garage
But I shoulda treated that pussy like a parking lot
Yeah, the players fucked up
She was loose as a goose but I should've ducked
Her, and sure, I still hit her up, but only to say I fuckin' hate you, bitch

I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face (Yeah)
And now my life is lookin' up now (I-I fuckin' hate when I'm insecure)
And she's already been replaced (Fuck)
I don't need her, you know I don't need her
I don't need her anymore (I fuckin' feel like I'm about to cry)
No, I don't need her
She know I don't need her (Like when Tom Hanks lost Wilson on Castaway)
But now she's seemin' insecure (Damn)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like
Uh, okay I got a new one
And she never pissed me off
That's a toilet bowl, no urine
And I used to think about you when I be wit' her
Oh, now you fly?
Bitch I knew you when you were a caterpillar
And homicide, crosses my mind
Once or twice I admit
I feel like an asshole, that ain't never have shit
Now some say love is a drug I beg to differ
'Cause I sniffed her, and I smelt another dick on her breath
And still kissed her
Fuck I'm stupid
I kidnap cupid
And teach him how to hate
Then teach him how to skate
No, you ain't on my calendar, but at least I got a date
To drown you out I buy a house, buy a beach and buy a lake
I fell defeat to my mistakes, but who doesn't?
I heard your man was gay
Does that mean you have 2 husbands?
You fuckin' slut
I'd do better fuckin' sluts up the butt
Then let you come and kiss the shit out my dick, pucker up
Ha
I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face
And now my life is lookin' up now
And she's already been replaced
I don't need her, you know I don't need her
I don't need her anymore
No, I don't need her
She know I don't need her
But now she's seemin' insecure
Yeah, yeah, yeah

See, when times get hard
So does my dick
And for some funny reason
I think of you
And um
I just wanna grab a rifle and
Shoot myself in the head because
I-I-I just can't get rid of the thoughts
Bitch

I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face
And now my life is lookin' up now As a matter of fact, let me take that rifle
And she's already been replaced And I'ma um
I don't need her, you know I don't need her I'ma swing by your crib
I don't need her anymore And um
No, I don't need her I hope your man is there
She know I don't need her I-I still got that key
But now she's seemin' insecure That you gave me
Yeah, yeah, yeah Ha
Hold up, hold up
Let me find that key
Alright, I got it
Yo, fuck both of y'all7Embed
