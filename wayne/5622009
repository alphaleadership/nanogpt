60 ContributorsMultiple Flows Lyrics
(Woah) Woah (Woah), okay
(Woah) Lil Uzi Vert
Who? (All the money on me)
It's Lil Uzi Vert
What? (Let's go)
(Ayy, Brandon, man, why you do that?)
It's Lil Uzi Vert

Damn, I got a plan
Multiple flows, I get multiple bands (What?)
Countin' it like I got multiple hands
Got multiple hoes every time that I land
I walked in this bitch with only five bands (Huh?)
Roll the dice, times that two, now I got ten
Roll the dice, my niggas movin' that tan (Ayy)
My bitches either sell weed or they scam (Ayy)
Water my neck, my shit look like a dam
TEC-9 a beaver, that shit do not jam (Ayy)
I will not wear no Evisus again (Ayy)
Number (N)ine, it's like Evisu times ten (What? Yeah)
We got them choppers that come with a vent (Ayy)
Electronic clip, it come with a sim
My Brooklyn bitch, she came with some Timbs (Ayy, huh?)
She tellin' her friends, I came with some M's (Ayy, damn)
You might also like
Workin' your bitch out in my private gym (Damn)
Nigga, I'm workin' her center (Her center, woah)
Bend her over 'cause I'm 'bout to enter (Bend her over, woo)
Like I'm intercontinental (Continental, woah, yeah, yeah)
Shot an opp on the, uh, accidental (Ayy)
Hit his teeth, need to call up his dental (Ayy)
None of my shooters on camera (Ayy, ayy)
Like Lil Uzi is a Amish member (Yeah)
Fuck my enemies and my foes (Ayy)
I can tell these niggas all hoes (Hoes)
When I come around, say they my bro
When I leave, say they fucked my ho
I spent five thousand for a coat
So you know I can't catch a cold
You said five thousand, I'm dumb
I said, "For five thousand, you broke" (Ayy)
Man, we gon' hang a pussy with a rope
That boy on Fentanyl and the soap (Woo)
Bitch, I was high off the dope (What?)
Pull up a double R, and I coast (Ayy)
Let the opps pull up to the show (Yeah)
We gon' put they ass in a glove
Rudolph, hit his ass in the nose
Man, I'll put that shit on bro
Damn (Hee), I got a plan (Yeah)
Multiple flows, I get multiple bands (Yeah)
Countin' it like I got multiple hands (Yeah)
Got multiple hoes every time that I land (Yeah, yeah)
I walked in this bitch with only five bands (Woah)
Roll the dice, times that two, now I got ten (Woah)
Roll the dice, my niggas movin' that tan (Woah)
My bitches either sell weed or they scam

Trust no man, not even the man in the mirror
My vibe in the mansion, she playin' in the mirror
I fuck her, get dressed, and go handle my business
This shit on my neck got my head on a swivel
I'm drownin' in my dream like my bed is a river
I wake up in beast mode, I ate her like Skittles
I'm colorblind, when I fade to black it look similar to
White gold and platinum and grey and to silver
I bust down a bustdown, that's self-motivation
I bust on her skin, now she exfoliatin'
I treat the nina like forever my lady
Got two extendos, that's a thirty for thirty
You ain't from around here, we need verification
These rocks is so big like I'm wearing a glacier
These streets is so cold, nigga, Hell a vacation
I'm street smart, lil' woadie, that's edumacation
And I had told young boy to watch out for oldhead
I told young boy that I'll knock off his old head
Told him I'll put his head right next to your head
I give my young boys the go 'head, code red
I don't sip nothin' but yurple, no red
She gon' hop on me, do circles, go 'head
I'ma hop out the convertible, no head
I'm lookin' mosaic, killin' hoes, OJ
Huh
And I was so trippy, I looked in the mirror, I didn't resemble me, nigga, uh
We was so litty, I forgot to tip her, she said, "You could Venmo me, nigga"
Niggas keep trippin', I look up at God and I swear he say, "Send me a nigga"
I'm Weezy F Baby, and please say the F like John F. Kennedy, nigga
I was so litty, I looked in the mirror and started to envy me, nigga
We was so litty, I forgot to tip her, but she know it's M-O-B, nigga
I got a plan, I fucked that lil' homie, it got out of hand
Wait, I'm not a fan, she gave me her only, but I'm not a fan
Damn (Ooh), I got a plan
Multiple flows, I get multiple bands (Bands)
Countin' it like I got multiple hands
Got multiple hoes every time that I land (Land)
I walked in this bitch with only five bands (Yeah)
Roll the dice, times that two, now I got ten (Damn, damn)
Roll the dice, my niggas movin' that tan (Roll the dice)
My bitches either sell weed or they scam (Ayy)
Water my neck, my shit look like a dam (Woo)
TEC-9 a beaver, that shit do not jam
I will not wear no Evisus again (No)
Number (N)ine, it's like Evisu times ten
We got them choppers that come with a vent (Buh)
Electronic clip, it come with a sim (Yeah)
My Brooklyn bitch, she came with some Timbs (Yeah)
She tellin' her friends, I came with some M's (Lil' bitch)

Yeah, add it up, add it up
Fucked that lil' homie, it got out of hand (Ayy)
Hey, hey, I'm not a fan (Ayy)
She gave me her only, but I'm not a fan (Ayy), no
Wait, I got a plan (Ayy)
Shout out to fam, shout out to fam (Ayy)
Yeah, I got a plan (Ayy)
Lil Tunechi, Lil Uzi, that's a power plan (Ayy)17Embed
