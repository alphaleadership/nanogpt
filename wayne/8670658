3 ContributorsInvasion Lyrics
Invasion, in-in-invasion, in-in-in-invasion, invasion, invasion

Double down already started (started), 60 seconds to blow, It's going down, already started, no way to stop it, at night, one foot on the floor

So just take me up above the satellites (let's just go, let's just go, let's just go, let's just go)
Cuz I feel like on the other sides tonight (let's just go, let's just go, let's just go, let's just go)

My defenses getting weak, and they're coming over me like a invasion, b-body invasion, b-body. Pulling on my hands, no I need a dance, like a invasion, b-body invasion, b-body
Defenses getting weak and they're coming over me like a invasion, b-body invasion, b-body. Electric in the party, invented in the party party invasion, b-body invasion (oh oh)

Like the floor Like you don't know, my body over the dancefloor, that invision, ready let's go, go, don't stop, I'm in the zone

I'm in the zone, my thoughts are racing, going outta control, like In a cycle, I'm in a situation, and it's spinning me all around, taking me upside down

So just take me up above the satellites (let's just go, let's just go, let's just go, let's just go)
Cuz I feel like on the other sides tonight (let's just go, let's just go, let's just go, let's just go)

My defenses getting weak, and they're coming over me like a invasion, b-body invasion, b-body. Pulling on my hands, no I need a dance, like a invasion, b-body invasion, b-body

We are not the same, I am a Martian, I got the aim you are the target (yeah). Carter harder than the hardest. I got more paper than a office. Okay Ashley, if your boyfriend is hot then I am acid. He can take you to his mansion, but I can take you to my planet. Let me invade that thing, Ima make you mine, like I made that thing, ima take my time, ima lay back mane, give me head I give you head, back sing

So just take me up above the satellites (let's just go, let's just go, let's just go, let's just go)
