6 ContributorsLil Weezyana Fest “Best Rapper Alive” Freestyle Lyrics
Now beam me up Scotty
You gon' find your mommy chopped up in a tub
With "Stop snitchin'" written on a note by her body
I picked up your ho and she wore something tiny
I wore something simple, she like that about me
My dope from the 90's, dope ain't consignment
Coke ain't that diet, I hope you a client
Niggas be snitching, bitches be lying
Niggas who snitchin' we throw to the lions
Ain't no testifyin', you know desert's quiet
Scream until you give your throat laryngitis, we so terrorizin'
You cuddle too much, you choose hoes to confide in
I know where you hide and that ho verified it
I told my homie, "I know where to find him"
He said, "You late, we already got him
And by the way, it was an honor"
That made my day, made me so proud
I bought my bitch some shit from her favorite designer
And a Chihuahua
What's the occasion? Don't worry about it
I don't fuck with snakes except Kobe, the Mamba
Might cut off my hair 'cause these hoes is Delilah's
Let me check my wallet, my pulse and my vitals
I am the greatest, I am retired
It's up in the air like carbon monoxide
We in the buildin', we started from outside
My dick is my third eye, she call it cockeyed
Run with me
Run through a threesome
This shit so wet, it can be sea sickening
Niggas expect some sort of leniency
I'm in high def, but why are you screening me?
I'm Weezy FYou might also like2Embed
