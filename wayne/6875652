16 ContributorsBatman (Remix) Lyrics
Remix, baby
I told her that I'm celibate ain't fuck in 'bout a week (I lied)
Psych, bitch, I lied, you can ride me to this beat (To this beat)
I hit her in the Benz, we fuckin' all in the street

Bitch, I can't be your Batman, all— all red on, I'm slatt man
Do numbers like a stat man, can't trust you like a black van
Had some bumps in the road, I turned it to a flat land
Your bitch lit, all my bitches litter like a cat, man
And my lil' mama my Robin, she fucked your guy and she robbed him
And all these dollars got commas that come with commas behind 'em
And all my slimers be slimin', we wipe his nostrils, he snotty
I swear that shotty like sinus and that Bugatti like Sonic
The— The— The hedgehog, how I speed off
Drop the top and take the head off
Pick a bitch up, drop some bread off
Get my dick sucked, take the edge off
Kill that pussy, knock it dead off
Then I fled off, clean your bed off
She gave me a blow job, I love that job, I can't get laid off
Had to get my shit straight before I dropped it
Glock— Glock got a dick, sell pussy, I wore a condom
I said, "Baby, I can't be your Batman," that's what I told her
Then— Then— Then I paint her whole face white just like the Joker, Tunechi

No, I can't be your Batman 'cause I be robbin' (Remix, baby, 'cause I be robbin')
I don't want no lap dance, bitch, give me noggin (Mula, baby, bitch, give me noggin)
Why you laughing and playing? Ho, get from 'round me (Ho, get from 'round me)
You know I am the man, Mr. Miyagi (Mr. Mi— what?)
Yeah, I got hoes from Japan, they call me papi (They call me)
I beat that pussy so good and leave it throbbing (And leave it, uh)
'Cause I be slangin' this wood, they wanna chop it (Talkin' 'bout, uh)
No, I can't cuff on lil' shawty, don't do no coppin' (Uh-huh)

You'll think it's 808 the way this beat knocking (Clap, clap)
Florida boy shit, when they hear it, they go to boppin' (Ayy)
She a lunch lady 'cause the jaw she give is sloppy (I swear)
Stuffin' dick all in her ribs and she keep begging me to stop it (Yeah, yeah, ayy)
They waiting for my mixtape, they telling me to drop it (Come on)
But I gotta get my shit straight before I drop it
I be cuttin' up, might pull the plug right out the socket (Right out the socket)
I cut 'em like some paper with these scissors then I rock it (Then I rock it)
Now I got the key to the city, so I'ma lock it (So I'ma lock it)
You stressed out, you just worry 'bout how I got it (How I got it)
I keep hunnids and fifties all in my profit (All in my profit)
My life a movie, it's sad, you gotta watch it (You gotta watch it)
Reach inside my pants and pull these bands out my pocket (Yeah)
I'ma make a mess in the city, they gotta mop it
Automatic stick come with titties, ain't gotta cock it
Glock got a dick, see a pussy and I'ma pop it (Ayy, yeah)
No, I can't be your Batman 'cause I be robbin' ('Cause I be robbin')
I don't want no lap dance, bitch, give me noggin (Bitch, give me noggin)
Why you laughing and playing? Ho, get from 'round me (Ho, get from 'round me)
You know I am the man, Mr. Miyagi (Mr. Mi— what?)
Yeah, I got hoes from Japan, they call me papi (Across the countries, hahaha)
I beat that pussy so good and leave it throbbing (Ugh, ugh, ugh, leave it, uh)
'Cause I be slangin' this wood, they wanna chop it (Tryna chop it, ah, ah, I swear)
No, I can't cuff on lil' shawty, don't do no coppin' (Don't do that, nah, go)

Go lil' vroom, hop out, pop it (Pop it)
In the coupe with some tropic (Tropic)
Give me room, I get nauseous
I sip Wocky, you won't catch me coughin'
Hold up, watch out how you talkin', your life cost a pair of Forces
We'll go shoot your stylist in the head for lettin' you think you saucy
You defeatin' the purpose, why you got it if you ain't gon shoot the stick? (Huh?)
I don't like nobody, fuck you, him, and who else you with (Nobody)
When you got the recipe, your product keep you in the mix (Facts)
She gon' have the nerve to say she don't like me, she just like the dick (Ugh)
Viking, I got open, ho was slurpin', I was smokin' (Ugh)
Bread on top of your head, boy, they can't wait to catch you loafin' (They can't wait to catch you)
Do some purple potion in this cup, move in slow motion
Throwin' rocks and hidin' your hand, you don't want smoke then don't provoke me (Don't do that)
No, I can't be your Batman 'cause I be robbin' (I be robbin')
I don't want no lap dance, bitch, give me noggin (Bitch, give me noggin)
Why you laughing and playing? Ho, get from 'round me (Ho, get from 'round me)
You know I am the man, Mr. Miyagi (Mr. Mi— what?)
Yeah, I got hoes from Japan, they call me papi (They call me)
I beat that pussy so good and leave it throbbing (And leave it, uh)
'Cause I be slangin' this wood, they wanna chop it (Talkin' 'bout, uh)
No, I can't cuff on lil' shawty, don't do no coppin' (Uh-uh, uh-uh)2Embed
