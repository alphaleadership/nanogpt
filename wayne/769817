2 ContributorsMy Name Is Leak Jones Lyrics
Ha-Ha-Ha
I Wish
That's right, baby

Uhh, slick diggy on my my one and two
So sweet what i did what a hunny do
No pun intendant, no one offended
You jump in and leave your girlfirend unattendant
I holla at her, holla but don't scream
I ask her why sleep if you don't dream
So lets stay awake besides dreams are fake
She said ooh you deep, i ask how deep can you take
My love boat in your lake
Baby can i spit my love note in your gate
Read em weep, sincerely fucking yours Weezy F. B
And my name is Weezy Baby, and I'm Young Mula Baby
Okay now shawty high, yellow shawty high crown
Shawty so gold and so is my crown
Baby color me bad
Shawty toe red
And so is my flag
Purple in my bag
Black girls like that
She ain't wanna, she ain't wanna let Wayne go
She just wanna wanna follow the Wayne grove
And i gun let her
Cause me and her colours create art
And my name is Weezy Baby
And i'm Young Mula Baby
I prefer that you would just call me Weezy
Eastside gangsta and i be running this shit
Like the flanker, black car banker
Hannker in the back pocket and i where them skinny jeans
So you see my fat wallet
That's right i'm a big shot
Call me little cannonball
Mister get up in your girl i'm all
Like sum imbecile
Hip hop president
And my girl eloquent
Don't she have more junk in her trunk
Than an elephant
Nigga im an animal
Watch me i examin' you
And my truck are old but i swear to you my flannel?
Man i get money manual
Then i just mang you
Bitch ass nigga
I'm gonna light my lan roof
