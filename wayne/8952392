Baby (Baby)
I know you like when I talk nasty to you
Ha-ha-ha

It's "Fuck me", then it's "Fuck you"
Send me your location, I'ma come through
I'ma put it down like you want me to
And every time we fuck, you say you love me too (DJ Drama)
Get in your bag, mhm, pullin' your tracks out
I put my kids in her mouth, put Louis V bags on her couch
I just put a new Patek on her, new VVS, got her iced out
And she like it when I fuck her lights out
And I gotta get her like right now

I like to spoil her, just 'cause I'm a baller
My bitch came with a bag, and she didn't need me supportin' her
My lil' boy only two and his neck is like a quarter (Brr)
I built anothеr house and I put it by the water
Diamonds dancin' on mе and it's like blue water
Your bitch from cross the block with my bitch from cross the border
Gucci Mane and Roddy dem, no way that y'all stoppin' him
Drama, that's my partna dem, drop tops, we be coppin' them (Drop)
Haters know who shot at them, ice cold but who's hot as him? (Brr)
We don't need no drop on them, coupe, find me, Guwop in here (It's Gucci)

It's "Fuck me", then it's "Fuck you"
Send me your location, I'ma come through
I'ma put it down like you want me to
And every time we fuck, you say you love me too
Get in your bag, mhm, pullin' your tracks out
I put my kids in her mouth, put Louis V bags on her couch
I just put a new Patek on her, new VVS, got her iced out
And she like it when I fuck her lights out
And I gotta get her like right now

Yeah, yeah
And she like it when I fuck her lights out
And I gotta get her like right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
And she like it when I fuck her lights out
She really like that
Tunechi

Uh
I be beatin' her back out, always got her ass out, I'ma be in her crackhouse
Got time on my hand, she said "I don't need no hand outs"
My skeet-skeet came with feet
And down that cheek get ran down
If it's "Fuck me", then it's "Fuck yeah"
I'ma spread her legs like Jumpman
I'ma jump in, I'ma crash land
I like a big booty, no flat land
I'ma eat the pussy like a fat man
I'ma beat the pussy like a back hand
Smack her whole booty, I don't half-ass
Got her walkin' funny, make her tap dance
Fill her car trunk up with Saks bags
Turn her handbags into cash bags
She a grown woman, she don't broadcast
That's hashtag, no hash tags
She got a soft ass, she got a fat ass
She got a boyfriend, with his whack ass
He a funny nigga, I get the last laugh
She got a cameltoe and I'm black sand, nigga
It's "Fuck me", then it's "Fuck you" (Fuck you)
Send me your location, I'ma come through (I'ma come through)
I'ma put it down like you want me to (Like you want me to)
And every time we fuck, you say you love me too (Like you love me too)
Get in your bag (Get in your bag), mhm, pullin' your tracks out (Pullin' your tracks out)
I put my kids in her mouth, put Louis V bags on her couch
I just put a new Patek on her, new VVS, got her iced out
And she like it when I fuck her lights out
And I gotta get her like right nowEmbed
