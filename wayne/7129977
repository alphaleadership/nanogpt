Wake up in the morning take a shit shower shave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slave
I whip it like a slave
Whip-whip it like a slave
Stand over the stove and (Then I) whip it like a slave (Young Money)
Wake up in the morning take a shit shower shave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slave
I whip it like a slave
Whip-whip it like a slave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slave

In that coupe likе don't whip me no more
Look how I whip it ohhhh, called child abusе
Let 'em out the cage, grilled chick filets
Pyrex looking like a glass of lemonade
Snow white, no dwarfs, just snow flakes
Stainless steel stove match the microwave
Metallic lambo, inside suede
Program to get it, I run off double A's
I whip it like I
I whip it like I
I whip it like Joe Jackson used to whip Mike
I whip it like Penny got it on Good Times
Sunrise cook them yams up sunny side
You might also like
I whip it like a slave
Whip-whip it like a slave
Whip it like a slave
Whip-whip it like a slave
I'm talking 36 ounces
Treat 'em like Chris Brown
Enough bricks I can build a townhouse

Wake up in the morning take a shit shower shave
Stand over the stove and (Then I) whip it like a slave
I whip it like a slave
Whip-whip it like a slave
Stand over the stove and (Then I) whip it like a slave
Wake up in the morning take a shit shower shave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slave
I whip it like a slave
Whip-whip it like a slave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slave


Wake up in the morning take a shit shower shave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slave
I whip it like a slave
Whip-whip it like a slave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slave
Wake up in the morning take a shit shower shave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slave
I whip it like a slave
Whip-whip it like a slave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slave
Yeah! Okay new day new yay
Then I whip it like Kunta Kinte
I'm talking sugar talking dough like a beignet
I take a brick karate chop it like a sensei
Haha, I does it the YM way
A bunch of drugs, bunch of money, bunch of templates
Bunch of ice, bunch of guns, bunch of switchblades
Fuck with my bunch of bunch of niggas up in his face
Check my pockets more money than lint
Check my kitchen every spoon in there bent
Check my dishes residue like a bitch
Big boy weight my residue like half a brick

I whip it like a slave
Whip-whip it like a slave
Whip it like a slave
Whip-whip it like a slave
I'm talking 36 ounces
Building snow mountains
More bricks than 24 houses

Wake up in the morning take a shit shower shave
Stand over the stove and (Then I) whip it like a slave
I whip it like a slave
Whip-whip it like a slave
Stand over the stove and (Then I) whip it like a slave
Wake up in the morning take a shit shower shave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slave
I whip it like a slave
Whip-whip it like a slave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slaveEmbed
