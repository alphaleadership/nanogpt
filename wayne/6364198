1 ContributorCanâ€™t Be Broken (Live On SNL) Lyrics
Ladies and gentleman, Lil Wayne

You cannot break down what can't be broken (Yeah)
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen (Yeah)
When all of the lights, they get low (Low)
And all of the curtains, they close (Close)
You cannot break down what can't be broken

Uh, they can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce, should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say now I'm raising you, ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors food
Be afraid of who? I made the loot
Money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I like my head a screw
Man, I'ma need some crazy glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you, errr
You might also like
You cannot break down what can't be broken (Broken)
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen (Chosen)
When all of the lights, they get low (They get low)
And all of the curtains, they close (They close)
You cannot break down what can't be broken

G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these bros
G-code (Can't be broken)

I ain't finna break or fix the brakes
You emulate, I'm laughing in your face
So fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil' a day
For like a million days
Least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
Stickin' out your chest, is really fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, get replaced
The heart was built to break
Smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
Got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break, rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to see Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break
You cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen (G-code)
When all of the lights, they get low (They get low)
And all of the curtains, they close (They close)
You cannot break down what can't be broken

G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these bros
G-code (Can't be broken)

To all the veterans, thank youEmbed
