4 ContributorsPick Nâ€™ Roll Lyrics
It's on!
This is gettin outta control
This is startin to get outta control (I can't feel my face!)
This is gettin outta control
I mean this is just gettin too crazy
Okay

Menace to society, weapon on the side of me
Spill a nigga blood on the side of these streets
Like it came with the property. I'm sick with the piece
Headshots like photography, say cheese
Wayne!

I come from where niggas die in the morning
The killers ride at night, fuck the cops and informants
And I never love the bitch, I only love the moments
Shit, I'm all about the bills like Thurman Thomas

Niggas bleed just like us, Biggie said it best
So picture me being scared of nigga made of flesh (never)
Money, drugs, sex
Yes, murder, death
Police got a full court press
You might also like
I release like fumes, from a jet
Don't worry I will be there soon, I'm on a jet
Just watching cartoons on a jet
Ears don't even pop, I'm immune to the jet. Yep

Four chicks at once so I got to push
That's more legs, in my bed than an octopus
And im runnin up they leg like they stockin should
And im checkin that pussy like a doctor would


So how you like a nigga now, wipe a nigga down
I only be with sharks, it's like a nigga drowned
Powder in the park, dope in the town
My sharks trying to find a nigga floating around

Money talks, bullshit walks
A thousand miles up the road get lost
Big Porsche, big pipes exhaust
Big booty bitch lookin something like a horse
Big body bent with the air on defrost
I'm fly like a wasp, I shine like gloss
Clean like floss, and I don't have to floss
I just wipe my teeth with a jewelry cleaning cloth

I tell niggas meet the metal
Beef gets settled, quickly
Feet to peddle, I'm gone
160, police gon catch who?
I treat the Porsche like a rental, abuse

Put it in the air like renuzit
Me and 'elz blues brothers I'm a play belushi
Modern day pacino, but this is not a movie
But I do watch movies when I sit in my jacuzzi


You know my hood is the 17th ward
But I throw it up anyway, like Brett Favre
Fast life liver, I ain't die yet
It's probably because I can talk life outta death

Hell, I could talk ice outta hell
I could talk the water out the well
I could talk a slug outta snail
I could talk a chick out herself
Then give me that pussy, bitch!

Cash Money, Young Money dipset ho
Gangbang yo ass like a dispet show
Tickle lil pillsberry and you get dat doee
Im on, X & O's like Tic Tac toe

Hold up! Take this Cris' back home
And bring back them bottles of that Perrier rose
And like my wrist, it better stay cold
Or ima have to put my wrist in a bowl
