7 ContributorsLover Lyrics
Young Money

This argument is just gonna keep going on and on
And at this point I don’t even really care who’s right or wrong
Uh, I just don’t wanna fight anymore
Even forgot we’re arguing for
And if you think this is the way to be
I’m sorry this ain’t gonna work for me

And I know, I know that no one’s perfect
But what’s the purpose if we can’t even make it through the day without fighting
We can’t even get along, I would just rather let it go

But girl you already know that
I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
See PJ Morton LiveGet tickets as low as $37You might also like
Uh, she say she love me but all we do now is fucking fight
Man I just pull them drawers over like they running lights
I gotta cut my phone off like I’m on a flight
Cause if I don’t she gon’ check it like a pair of nikes
Why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Trippin’ like you stepped on a crack, you wack
Come on, uh, don’t start honey
I put that dick up on you good and make you walk funny
See I’m a lover not a fighter, but I beat that pussy up
And I may not be Mr. Perfect, but we make perfect couple
I think so and you drink so
Chill ‘fore I put your ass out like a single
Shit gon’ get real if you don’t quit it
Everybody gotta limit
We argue over bullshit and you ain’t Scottie Pippen
Uh, but I ain’t trippin’ on your ass
I wonder what would you ever do if I went missin’ on your ass
Tunechi

And I know, I know that no one’s perfect
But what’s the purpose if we can’t even make it through the day without fighting
We can’t even get along, I would just rather let it go
(Young Mula Baby)
Cause you should already know that
I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover, I’mma lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter1Embed
