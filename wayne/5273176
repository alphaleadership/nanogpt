23 ContributorsWe Livin’ Like That Lyrics
I'ma put my niggas where my heart go (Heart go)
Burner by the car door
Also the torso, point it at your cornrows (Cornrows)
Shoot  'em where his thoughts go (Bah)
What you said? I thought so
You don't wanna spark woe (Nope)
'Cause I'm feeling like charcoal (Ayy)
I'm feeling like a lost soul
Boy, I'm in war mode (War mode)
Highway to Heaven, nigga (Errp)
I can take you off-road

Even though I'm way up, I still finesse (I still finesse), yeah
Even though I'm prayed up, I feel possessed (Dang)
I don't know, man, it's like lately (Lately), I ain't been myself (Nope)
I looked into the mirror and I see somebody else
I don't recognize the face that I wear (Damn)
I look into my eyes and ain't nobody there and I'm sleeping with a bitch I don't know (Who is you?)
She sleeping with the dick down her throat, oh lord
What if some niggas kick down the door?
I shoot it out then hide behind the ho
Nigga, what? I'm living like that, yeah
Nigga, what? I'm living like that, yeah (Yeah)
You might also like
Nigga, what? You can die like that
Don't try like that
Sour grapes, nigga, 'cause you whine like brats
I don't see these niggas 'cause they shine like black
I'ma throw some bullets in the sky, nice catch
In the sky blue 'vette repping Piru set (Suwoop)
Hop up out that bitch like Batman (Yeah)
You get a toe tag quicker than a hashtag (Haha)
I cut his feet off, tell that nigga tap dance
I cut his wings off, make a nigga crash land (Woo)
I need a theme song, nigga, I'm a masked man
You talk trash, nigga, only to the trash man (Yeah)
These pussycat niggas need a CAT scan (Yeah)
I'm a mob boss asking what the crime cost (Yeah)
On my high horse seeing who I can buy off (Yeah)
Got a chauffeur somewhere up in my garage lost
Got some codeine poured up for a dry cough
Nigga, I'm living like that (Pour up), yeah
Nigga. what? I'm sipping like that (Pour up), yeah

Lord, they can take me away, carry me in the wind
Bury me with a grin
Salary may offend
Now a bad-ass bitch sharing me with her friend
And I started from the bottom like a tree with a stem (Woo)
Now I feel like 50 Cent 'cause I see many men
Wish death upon me like a genie with them
But I put the burner barrel to his beanie and brim
And leave a blood pool, put on your bikini and swim (Woo)
Motherfucker, don't try, don't you even attempt (Yeah)
I don't even want beef, I want linguine and shrimp
Lamborghinis and martinis and a suite full of nymphs
Fat stinky backwood, a swisher sweet with some length, boy
And when it's them I got the heat with the "nth" (Yeah)
Magazine extend, and my Nina a twin
I don't know two other bad sisters meaner than them
I call them Venus and Serena, they hyena your limbs
And we livin' like that, yeah (Yeah)
Nigga, what? You could get it like that (Like that, nigga), yeah
I'ma put my niggas where my heart go (Heart go)
Burner by the car door (Car door)
Also the torso, point it at your cornrows (Cornrows)
Shoot 'em where his thoughts go (Bah)
What you said? I thought so
You don't wanna spark woe
'Cause I'm feeling like charcoal (Ayy)
I'm feeling like a lost soul
Boy, I'm in war mode (War mode)
Highway to Heaven, nigga
I can take you off-road, I can take you off-road
Woah
Welcome to the crossroads
Woah, yeah

See, one thing about me, nigga
I don't give two fucks about these niggas
I'm three ticks from bombing, nigga
I'm four sips from drowning, nigga
I'm five star if you're counting, nigga
