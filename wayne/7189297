3 ContributorsCan’t Believe It Lyrics
I can put you in the log cabin
Somewhere in Aspen
Girl ain't nothing to the pain
Ain’t tricking if you got it what you asking for
I put you in the mansion
Somewhere in Wisconsin
Like I said ain't nothing to the pain
We can change your last name, what's happening
’Cause you look so good
Tell me why you wanna work here
I'll put you on the front page of King Magazine
But you gon get yourself hurt here, eh, ey

Babe I brought you in the back just to have a conversation
Really think you need some ventilation
Let's talk about you and me

Ooo, I can't believe it
Ooo-ooo shе all on me, on me
Man, man I think she want mе
Nah, I can't leave her lonely now
Ooo, I can't believe it
Ooo-ooo, she all on me
Man, man I think she want me
Nah, I can't leave her lonely, no
You might also like
I could put you in the condo
All the way up in Toronto
Baby put you in the fur coat
Riding the Murciélago
I put you in the beach house
Right on the edge of Costa Rica
Put one of them flowers in your hair
Have you looking like a fly mamacita, fuego (Fuego)
You look so good
I wanna spend it all on you
Get up out this club
Slide with your boy
We can do what you wanna, yeah, hey

Baby, I brought you in the back 'cause you need a little persuasion
And you need a little ventilation
Let’s talk about you and me

Oh, I can’t believe it
Ooo-ooo, she all on me
Man, man, I think she want me
Nah, I can't leave her lonely, no
Ooo, I can’t believe it
Ooo-ooo, she all on me
Man, man, I think she want me
Nah, I can't leave her lonely, no
And understand she make the people say yeah, yeah, yeah
She hit the main stage and make the people say yeah
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah
You don't understand she make the people say yeah
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeahEmbed
