2 ContributorsBe Me Lyrics
I gotta get that swagga about myself, ya understand
Light that thing from the ass end baby, yeah
And I'm a take ‘em all the way there Boo
Hot Spitta, can I get ‘em? Can I speak the truth?
That, I will do, you know, fo’ sho’, yeah
And I'm a take ‘em all the way there Boo
Mack Maine can I bring ‘em to Tha Carter 2?
C'mon

Ridin’ by myself, late night, left arm on the steering wheel, red light
Lookin’ through the rear view
Hoping I don't see the thirsty thief nor the cop
You in the next lane hatin’ cause you couldn't afford the drop
Switch gears, feet clutch, keep up, eat dust, try me, he busts
I don't give a sister, brother, father, mother-fuck, fuck -
There goes the lawyers more bucks, but

I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all
But
I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all

So when you see me in the streets don't speak, ‘cause I ain't even tryna holla if it's not about a dollar
See me straightening my collar, lookin' good for the women
Putting good in them Phillies, blowin’ good on you bitches
I go - wherever the money take me
I'm there, baby, I'm faithfully on my job
No lady cause she don't understand the way I gotta shine
Thinking a nigga crazy, but the streets, they thinking I'm getting paid like Baby
Who am I, to tell ‘em anything different, I'm a make it
I get it just how I say it, gotta pay it how I weigh it
I'm only 145, soaking wet, butt naked and the scale don't lie
The food must be going to my mind, food for thought, I hope you eat 3 times
I'm a be here for a while, if you don't like daddy cooking then you better eat out
Young Money we out
If you here leave out
If you coming, re-route, but

I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all
But
I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all
Pops is no sucker, moms a bit tougher
September 27th is when heaven dropped a bundle
I rose to my feet and stumbled
If I ain't come to get money, then I can go back to where I come from
And leave without a gun is a joke, if I ever heard one
And scary niggas don't deserve one, I heard once
A fool and his money soon part ways, so, I'm a stay smart and stay paid like that, but

I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all
But
I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all
But
I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all
But I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’allEmbed
