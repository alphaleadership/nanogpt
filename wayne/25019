4 ContributorsLil Boyz Lyrics
Huh

You lil boyz don't know what it mean to get shot
You lil boyz don't wanna do nothin' but hang on the block
Yoy lil boyz ain't ready to go to the pen
You lil boyz ain't ready to be sleepin' with nothin' but men
You lil boyz better stay in your place
You lil boyz ain't gon' be scared until you catch you a case
You lil boyz be out here sniffin' that furl
You lil boyz gotta get loaded just to go in that world
You lil boyz had better hit you a lick
You lil boyz shouldn't have to ask another nigga for shit
You lil boyz don't even respect your momma
You lil boyz don't even have the sense to be a Big Tymer
You lil boyz swear to God it's a game
You lil boyz gotta kill somethin' and get you a name
You lil boyz always be makin' a scene
You lil boyz wanna be grown, and you're still in your teens

Look, you lil' boyz better slow down
Up in the mornin', in the court, it's 'bout to go down
Here come them niggas: Soulja, Reebok, and Girbaud down
There's no remorse now
'Bout to explode rounds
Look, you lil' boyz better slow down
Up in the mornin', in the court, it's 'bout to go down
Here come them niggas: Soulja, Reebok, and Girbaud down
There's no remorse now
'Bout to explode rounds
See Juvenile LiveGet tickets as low as $81You might also like
You lil' boyz better clear the block
Cause somebody done ran in my money spot
Cock the Glocks, we prepared to pop
Can't let it slide cause these lil' boyz ain't right
Somebody gon' die tonight when we ride tonight
I'ma clear your set if I heard your name up in my mess
Best make a set trap, bust back with booby traps
You're outta line if you're playin' with mine
Fuck these bezzel bitch niggas gon' meet the devil
Lil' boyz don't know they playin' with rainy weather
Fuckin' with my cheddar
B.G., Wayne, Juvie, Big Tymers, whatever
But, however, if I could do
I'ma cook your hood like I cook up pill-goods, fool

Look, you lil' boyz better slow down
Up in the mornin', in the court, it's 'bout to go down
Here come them niggas: Soulja, Reebok, and Girbaud down
There's no remorse now
'Bout to explode rounds
Look, you lil' boyz better slow down
Up in the mornin', in the court, it's 'bout to go down
Here come them niggas: Soulja, Reebok, and Girbaud down
There's no remorse now
'Bout to explode rounds
Look
Check it out, check it out
You lil boyz make it happen, pack up y'all shit
You lil boyz need to go ahead on and quit, see
You lil boyz know y'all time is up
You lil boyz need to (Gimme gimme gimme), get the fuck
You lil boyz kinda like had '99
But look, you lil boyz from today to lights out, it's mine
You lil boyz need to  with y'all's friends
You lil boyz really women with paws like mens
You lil boyz stay out mine and worry 'bout yurn
You lil boyz is the right hook for this song cause y'all children
You lil boyz need to stop stealin' my beats
You lil boyz think a producer won't take y'all off y'all feets
You lil boyz know I do beats for twenty
You lil boyz add that up: zero zero zero, comma, aw, fuck it, it's plenty
You lil boyz tell y'all baby-momma I'm back in town
You lil boyz smiles done turned into frowns (Look, look)

When I ride, dawg, chopper be on my side, dog
Niggas betta run, duck, hide,dog, 'cause I'm about to let bullets fly, dog
Bahdi-by-by, get it right, nigga
They all know Lil Weezy ride at night, nigga
I dip low, and I'm strapped up tight, nigga
Duct tape your momma, and shoot off in your wife, nigga
Look, ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
Keep sprayin', the MAC-11 burst, hit 'em where it hurts
I'ma shoot first, soak his shirt (Ksshhh!)
Blood all over the place
Hit the block, have thugs all over the place
It's Lil Wayne, nigga, whoa now
If you don't think you can hang, nigga, slow down
Look, you lil' boyz better slow down
Up in the mornin', in the court, it's 'bout to go down
Here come them niggas: Soulja, Reebok, and Girbaud down
There's no remorse now
'Bout to explode rounds
Look, you lil' boyz better slow down
Up in the mornin', in the court, it's 'bout to go down
Here come them niggas: Soulja, Reebok, and Girbaud down
There's no remorse now
'Bout to explode rounds

Look, you lil boyz need to slow down
Look, you lil boyz need to slow down
Look, you lil boyz need to slow down
Up in the mornin', in the court, it's 'bout to go down
