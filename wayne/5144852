8 ContributorsRap City Freestyle  Lyrics
Homie we don’t get in the slam dunk contest no mo, you know how that go dog
To all you cats. However, from the block to the rats. Cash Money got this shit, right. So I'mma let my lil' soldier, Lil' Weezy Wee, shut this game down, for me, homie
Okay, listen

Homie I go hard, push a whip with no hair on his head
So all I’m feeling is air on my head
With some broad that you might know, she blowin' all the air out my head
If you play I’ll knock a square out your head
Sip the Crissy clear out my head, try to get my loot up
In Cuba with a translator, get the coke newer
Plus the prices is cooler, I come back to the hood with that dirty
Tell 'em I'm like Tiger Woods, all I got is birdies
Got women’s in they thirties calling Weezy papa
But Weezy not daddy ma 'cause Weezy in and out chea
Weezy never spouse ya, Weezy give sh*t bout’ cha
Weezy don’t master suite, Weezy living room couch ya
How bout you be a good girl, take these pies I just cooked up
Take me to those tiger paws on your thighs
Get’s high 'til I can’t focus, but the main focus is to remain focused, they ain't’ focused, holla back

...

Listen, I come up from a shh deep town
Where you hear sounds like click, squeak, pow!
Get down or your dying
People tote iron
Got that coke flying like birds-not the ones with feathers
I’m talking weight like birds
And you might get served if it’s proper enough
Or find your nerves on a curve if you’re a copper or something
A baller blocker or something
I’ll send your noggin a hundred
Have the whole block sprint, dashing, jogging and running
Type of life I live, Gotti would love it
Squad property buddy, some young cats with a Mafia budget
Can’t nobody put nobody above it
If they do they find they body with they body above it, come on let’s take it public
Nah leave it in the gutter
Ayy let's go and dump him
Nah leave him in the gutter

Check me
Now I got this game on lock with pounds and chickens
Give me 600 an ounce and 10 for the pigeons
I flood my community, I love this shhh
I think the FEDs done been in my house and bugged the shhh
Now I’m running everything from the hall in the blizzock
And I'm riding in the vol with my dog with no tizzop
Got a .40 in the arm rest and in the lap is the glizzock
I done copped a little platinum and I blessed it with rizzocks
The way a nigga live is unbelievable
And im riding round' in something you'd never seen before
Better watch your baby mama before I ceased it yo1Embed
