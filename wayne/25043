3 ContributorsWhite Girl Lyrics
I'm a hundred percent hussla from my face to my feet
My lifetime cases the street, my dime places the street
Until I wake and see another fuckin' day is relief
I pray that he keep, I'm scrappin' my knees from chasing this cheese
I had point guard dreams of playin for some team
Hit the block and made NBA money in one week
See I hussle in the hood and plus I fly birdies
And play the tracks out every month so I can ride dirty
Needed someone to manage my money I hired Shelly
But Shelly started talkin' to much so she died early
They got me loadin' up my Benz with my eyes blurry
I sent the message to the fucker at bout five thirty
Now if the bitch ain't got my dice for me then I'm sorry
But i'ma leave everyone who outside bloody
And then I go in the stash get the coke and the cash
I'm lettin' niggas score it for half, I'm hopin' it last
But still nigga don't, I might have to just go in the lap
And if its slow in the ass back to the rope and the mask

Man we got that white girl
And we could talk about a price to make it right for you
And if you like that alright then we got what you need
And if you like that nasty broad then we got low ki's
Dawg who got him?
We got that white girl
Man we got that white girl
And we could talk about a price to make it right for you
And if you like that alright then we got what you need
And if you like that nasty broad then we got low ki's

I hate when a nigga flex up and he's makin' it sound
As though he been doin that border, but that nigga would drown
My block been infiltrated by a whole lot of fake ass niggas
Scared ass niggas, won't even bust a grape ass niggas
I'm talkin to you! so take it how you want ho
I've been here for a minute, so I looked up and you don't move
Ya partners been fuckin wit ya cause they know how you is
Niggas be smackin ya and humpin you and snatchin yo shit
Matter fact get the fuck out my face, before I put you in ya place
I'm one second from bustin' the drapes
Well you can get ya money and all but not ch'ere
Lil daddy I been runnin' this section for 5 years, first of all I don't like ya
I don't know ya, run and get ya gun if you want I'm gon show ya
You one of them niggas  try  earning your stripe
Lil daddy I'm one of them niggas that'll hit ya at night

That liquor like dope nigga, I gots to have it
Cook flip the brick with some heavy traffic
Guns gon' bust if these niggas be lackin'
Cadillac, gold spokes, brick head, and baskets
Overflow this bitch white work gone faster
Tragedy of a murder case twisted and laughin'
In the Bentley drop top and Pac is blastin'
Hit the hood jumpin' the cop, we start the stashin'
Bunch of white t-shirts phone calls harassment
Bought a pot on that shit make it hot and ejectin'
He standin on my two feet he purrin', "I ain't blastin"
Coming up from childhood days about my cashing
Hundred g's on the trunk of the Escalade Cadi
I never did listen , I never mind my daddy
My brother gave him a game cookin' in an ally
Four bricks two guns I'm runnin' to my parents

Man we got that white girl
And we could talk about a price to make it right for you
And if you like that alright then we got what you need
And if you like that nasty broad then we got low ki's
Dawg who got him?
We got that white girl
