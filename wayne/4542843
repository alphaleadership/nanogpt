(Audio)
Ayo, Trina! You ready?
Ayy, Nic'! Let’s get 'em! Yeah
Light the blunt

This is for French Montana, Tory Lanez and friends
J. Harden, and you, too, Mr. Martin
I curved y'all boys (No disrespect to y’all boys)
Yeah, I curved y'all boys (No disrespect to y'all boys)
And to my niggas with bitches that like causin' drama
Me and my bad bitches, we like "Fuck his baby mama"
He cop me them Chanel bags, them diamonds VVS
You see this 500 million dollar mansion that's wrapped 'round my neck

This is for the ones who happily always toppin' me sloppily
If your money Monopoly, I ain't fuckin’ you properly (No)
He been tryin’ the liquor, taste like a strawberry daiquiri
The interior chicken and the exterior broccoli
When I come through in that Range Rov', the Barbie chain glow
Keep a baddie with me and we curve ’em like a rainbow
Rockin' ice grills like some serious bitches (Let's go)
It's the Barbie and the baddest, Sagittarius bitches

Give me a project bitch
Give me a hood rat chick
One that don’t give a fuck
And say she took that dick
Give me a project chick
Give me a hood rat bitch
One that don't give a fuck
And say she took that dick

I know a dude named Wayne that I used to fuck
I slid on him, got a check, then I was off in that truck
Ferrari photo, hit the gas, left foot on the clutch
Countin' money bags, shit, I been bossin' up

I know this ball player that I been wantin' to fuck
I deal with rich niggas and all of them give it up (Uh-huh)
Project bitches, ass fatter than the rest of them (Yeah)
Bitches so bad, got him cuffin' and arrestin' 'em (Oop)
Yeah, he shoots dice (Okay), his coupes is nice (Uh-huh)
I be playin' with his balls (Why?), 'cause hoops is life (Okay)
Got a New York nigga, Miami nigga
Always yellin' "gang gang" with the hammer, nigga
I got a ass eatin' pro (Oh), he's suckin' my toes (Yeah)
Got a bitch bussin' off like calico (Haha)
I got a beggin'-ass dude, want me to ride his face
Got a young side-nigga, gotta hide my face (Rrr)
Give me a project bitch
Give me a hood rat chick
One that don't give a fuck
And say she took that dick
Give me a project chick
Give me a hood rat bitch
One that don't give a fuck
And say she took that dick

It's the two baddest bitches that they love to hate
We racin' yachts, it's a bad bitch holiday
It's Barbie and Cinderella in Gucci and Donatella
I got a young rich nigga with a trap in Alpharetta
I got a couple Haitian niggas who be swipin' them cards
Gettin' that income tax money, takin' trips with Minaj
I know some West Coast niggas wanna bang me out
I show you what a project chick is about, show us the money

Give me a project bitch
Give me a hood rat chick
One that don't give a fuck
And say she took that dick
Give me a project chick
Give me a hood rat bitch
One that don't give a fuck
And say she took that dick18Embed
