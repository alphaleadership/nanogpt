12 ContributorsTell Me (Remix) Lyrics
Bobby Valentino *laughs*
(You back, son)
Ah, ayo Tim, drop that beat for me

Hey, slide over here and talk to the boy
What are you drinking? I'mma buy the bar
I was just thinking of seeing you tomorrow
Waking up with no panties, no bra
I ain't being nasty, I'm just being for real
Let me take off my belt and give you the whip appeal
Yeah, you hear about what I do in the streets
But you gon' love what I do in the sheets
Ha!

Say, baby, what's your story?
You got the goods, it's plain to see
The kind that'll keep a brother on his knees
And I'm so curious
After the club, hang out with me
Valentino is sure to please
For now, let's have an Apple Martini
And get to know each other
You might also like
Ooh, now, tell me
How did you get that in those jeans?
The way you popping in, it's killing me
Look over here, come follow me
Tell me
How did you get that in those jeans?
The way you dropping in, it's killing me
I'll meet you in the VIP

Ooh, you sizzling, wanna lay you on the floor
I'm a bad boy, just thought I'd let you know
These are the thoughts running through my mind
'Cause I'm so curious, yeah
Couple more shots, then we out the door
Speed off in the coupe, 'cause there's more in store
Can't wait 'til I pull in my driveway, girl
Can tell by now, I want you, yeah

You's a sexy thing
Ooh, what's your name?
'Cause you're the finest thing that walked in the club
Your girls, they don't compare to
You, can't help but stare at you
Let's make a toast to the good life
Ooh, now, tell me (Yeah)
How did you get that in those jeans?
The way you popping in, it's killing me
Look over here, come follow me
Tell me
How did you get that in those jeans? (I got you, pimp)
The way you dropping in, it's killing me (It's ya baby, baby, haha, yeah!)
I'll meet you in the VIP

Fly for a baby, eyes all hazy
Izod maybe all the Ape is bathing
Ride with a gangsta, we high where the weather be
Precious like ya face, so heavenly
I'm thanking God, like I better be
You know I'm very street
And if we get caught, you can be my accessory
Access to the condo in Miami
Have breakfast on the floor, butt naked we tanning
But, I'm too dark to tan
Mama, pardon ya man
Let me spark while I can, you know
Now you got my eyes following the places you go
I'm caught up in ya vibe tryna kick it like Judo
Luda outta town, I got the keys to the 2-door
And we ain't gotta tell no one about the things you know
You know, holla at a G though
I'm probably out wilding with Bobby Valentino, yeah
You's a sexy thing
Ooh, what's your name
'Cause you're the finest thing that walked in the club (You're the finest thing, yeah)
Your girls, they don't compare to
You, can't help but stare at you
Let's make a toast to the good life

Ooh, now, tell me
How did you get that in those jeans?
The way you popping in, it's killing me
Look over here, come follow me
Tell me (Oh, baby)
How did you get that in those jeans?
The way you dropping in, it's killing me
I'll meet you in the VIP
Ooh, now, tell me
How did you get that in those jeans? (Oh)
The way you popping in, it's killing me
Look over here, come follow me (Baby)
Tell me
How did you get that in those jeans?
The way you dropping in, it's killing me
I'll meet you in the VIP (Oh, oh)1Embed
