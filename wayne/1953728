2 ContributorsHow to Love LyricsYou had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Never had a love
When you was just a young'un your looks but so precious
But now you're grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
You might also likeSee you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault
Wasn't in your intentions
You the one here talking to me
You don't wanna listen
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad
Nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
Oooh
See I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeah
And I want you to know, you're far from the usual
Far from the usual
You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together

How to love
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
