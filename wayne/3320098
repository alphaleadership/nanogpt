4 ContributorsOops (Freestyle) Lyrics
Huh, huh, yeah
I'ma murder this shit
Alright, it's Weezy Baby!
Ayy, listen here, come here, ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy

I tell you what I did last night
I made love in a bitch wig last night
Them chrome dubs up on the Benz fit tight
We stone up the stick ick gimmie light
Laughin' on the island nigga livin' right
But I got ta go ta ATL to N.Y then it's back to the N.O
Don't fuck around I put this mack to ya rib and blow
It's Weezy Baby, I'm baggin' in this bitch for sure
I'm packin' a fifth, I'm baggin' a four
Kilo package of blow for twenty it go
In ya tummy where the Semi would go
And I pull the trigga right after I wisper gimmie ya coke
And I'm charged off myself in this millenium flow
Man I might go to ya girl and tell her gimmie ya throat
Cause a pimp don't give a shit about offendin' a hoe
My hoe's fuck my friends, I find no friend in a hoe
And the women a go

Oops, oh my
Baby see the whip ain't got no roof we so fly
And the feds ain't got no proof I sold pies
So I do like I do I'm so squad
You might also like
You see, I tried and I tried to keep goin'
But I'm, so high from the lie I keep blowin'
If I'm, gon' ride then it got ta be foreign
Yeah me no supply less than four and a half
Quit school went into the draft
I been puttin' numbers up since that
Been pullin' up in Hummers since that, so check my interior
So clean, so young, so what, so serious
Weezy do it all, man, I touch all areas
Sports agency, oh, plus I'm the best at this
I'm a mess at this, but I ain't trippin'
I leave rap to nothin' dizzy, I'm to fuckin' busy
17 'til I'm finished
Back in this, crack chemist
I murder that witness
What a burner that shit, we probably murder that spinich
But I ain't tryin' to fuck up me in feds image
They say, Tun' oh my
They say the boy so small he got to poke out
And all my cars own poke outs
Lu Baby call all the boys let's have a smoke out
And if you war with the boys we have a shoot out
July 2nd Cash Money pull the truth out
I'm bout to candy and chrome me a coupe out
I'm so cool gettin' dome when I move out
I have no home, the boy move out
So if you try to find me, Lil Weezy Wee be on that loop rout
How many chickens been to dudes house, trick question
Bitches or bricks now keep guessin'
Nigga take a swigga and flip, so keep playin' boy
You fucking with the Eastland Lords, niggaEmbed
