5 ContributorsEchota Yoda Lyrics
Them things still knowin' what they goin' for
I'm heavy in a couple cities, don't tell the informers
Chevy 16 inches, 10 switches, drop top old school hold 10 bitches
Fool them riches, get both of them digits
No new nigga compare to Young
Nuts hung low, ho', prepare your tongue
Yeah, the game been hurtin', I'm the medicine, ahead of em, I ain then squirt at the rest of 'em, motherfuck 'em
I'm the boy on fire like  Corduroy
Reppin' the ghetto, I get money forever, I got two clips taped together, that's a hunnid, whatever, lovin' the cheddar
Call me mozzarella, it's no sweat, I can hustle in the hottest weather
I'm Weezy fuckin' baby, La Zattera
P.S. a few shots to whoever, yeah

Bands, big bands in the jewelry store
Dance, diamonds dancin' like a group of hoes
Left the club, round five but you know it's on
Just got a picture of the titties on the camera phone
I get inside her head, she give me frontal lobe
I make her gimme more throat than the baritone
Pullin' up, shouldn’t drive 'cause I'm way too throwed
Call a Uber when I'm done, they could take me home
I'm the truth, never lie to no lady, ho'
Especially when the music on the radio
Walkin' through the halls and they play my song
Mama walkin' out the room, she got nothin' on
Hoes trynna pump me up, smoke just like Amaco
Oh yes, they might trip but then that means they gone
Don't fuck with classy bitches, don't get me wrong
Barely wearin' clothes, showin' camel toe
Rollin' up a swisher, so I'm in the zone
Lightin' up a blunt, take one to the dome
Oh yeah, that's my bitch, what they got goin' on?
This ain a hot — summer unless you on the song
Sick, too sick, think I got a cold
Diamonds dancin' all around like the merry-go
Lit, so lit, burnin' through it, dough
I'm 'bout set flame and fire to the Louis storeYou might also likeEmbed
