We are not the same, I am a Martian
It's young Weezy F. Baby, no abortion
I have foursomes and I don't have to force 'em
They just do what I say, jack, like Wheel of Fortune
I'm heartless and iced out, see
I got an icebox where my heart used to be, huh
Young Money, baby, you know who we are
And I could play with that pussy, like I play that guitar, yeah

The bass rock drum make the crowd act a fool (Yeah)
I got them gangstas, hood stars, pop stars screamin', "Totally dude"
Make clubs rock, rock (Rock), they know that I rock

Diamonds in my skull belt (Skull) they know that I'm the hardest (Yeah)
Black shades around my face, lookin' rockstar-ish

Yeah, we the Shop Boyz, nobody could've did it better (Come on)
We on fire, the black Red Hot Chili Peppers
My rock swag you could tell and see from a distance
Keep a chick with a Mohawk that's way thicker than Delicious
She stay head-hearted when I speak, she don't talk (Nah)
It ain't the braids that got the "A" rockin' Mohawks (Come on)
Chamillionaire, Wayne, Jim, yeah, we rock hard (Yeah)

First they rockin' and then they lean, some be plottin' to get my bling
But you know that metal rocket always pocketed in my jeans
Heavy metal, jewelry yellow, I'm obscene plus I'm ghetto
Have your queen in stilettos, pullin' strings like Geppetto
All-all-all I know is Fetty, tell me what you mean
Call me the Grinch, Shrek, yes, all I like is green
I am Bruce Bling-steen, step in the club and I grab her
If I want her I could have her, Mick Jagger with my swagger

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame need another couple names
Shop Boyz, Lil Wayne and Chamillitary, mane
Yeah, come do the show and forget the call (Call), tear up the club just to piss you off (Off)
Get on my bus and go hit the mall, and buy your earring the size of a crystal ball

(Yeah) Party like a rock, party like a rockstar (Remix, baby)
(Y-y-yeah) Party like a rock, party like a rockstar (Remix, baby)
(Y-y-yeah) Party like a rock, party like a rockstar (Remix, baby)
(Y-y-yeah) Party like a rockstar, t-t-totally dude
(Yeah) Party like a rock, party like a rockstar
(Y-y-yeah) Party like a rock, party like a rockstar
(Y-y-yeah) Party like a rock, party like a rockstar
(Y-y-yeah) Party like a rockstar, t-t-totally dudeEmbed
