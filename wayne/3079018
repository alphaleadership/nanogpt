You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fills the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up

You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fills the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
