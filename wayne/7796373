I wake up, my head hurts
But she got a couple blunts and Percocets in her purse
I can't front, I want first
If she got the good bag, I'ma pay what it's worth
She's my drug dealer girl, yeah
Drug dealer girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
Drug dealer girl, ooh
Drug dealer girl

Whole pound, just touched down, I flew it in myself
I just made this town mine, I sell it out
My back seats recline, I used to ride the train
Hit her line, my cup filled up with purple rain
My anatomy's made up of alcohol
It's been sevеnty hours on Adderall
These ain't cavitiеs, it's platinum in my teeth
Stoner and a loner, call her up, she coming over (Hey)

I wake up, my head hurts
But she got a couple blunts and Percocets in her purse
I can't front, I want first
If she got the good bag, I'ma pay what it's worth
She's my drug dealer girl, yeah
Drug dealer girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
Drug dealer girl, mmm
Drug dealer girl, uh

I'm so in love with her
My hoe, my drug dealer
I sell my soul to her
Without no refunds, nigga
I woke up numb in her
I smoke like guns with her
I don't need lungs, nigga
I'm god to all these nuns, sister
Whole pound, just touched down
Fuck it, let's throw a party
Hard drugs, mixed off ass
I'm snortin' coke off it
It took me seven days to get to know insomnia
My plug is my bae, somebody stole my charger

I wake up (Yeah), my head hurts
But she got a couple blunts and Percocets in her purse (Yeah)
I can't front, I want first
If she got the good bag, I'ma pay what it's worth
She's my drug dealer girl, yeah
Drug dealer girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
Drug dealer girl, mmm
Drug dealer girl
It's hard to function when I'm without you, without you
It's hard to function when I'm (When I'm) without you (Without you), without you (Without you)
It's hard to function (Yeah, yeah) when I'm (When I'm) without you (Without you), drug dealer girl (Without you)
It's hard to function (Yeah, yeah) when I'm (When I'm) without you (Without you), drug dealer girl
