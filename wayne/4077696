41 ContributorsGenius (Lil Wayne Remix) Lyrics
Wayne

Uh, I'm a genius, under pressure, no question, I'm really special
Upper echelon when I bless you, molest you with intellectual
It's a pleasure, it gets sexual, women lemon complexion
Quick connections, then ejections, my love is so ambidextrous
I'm a genius and perfectionist, specialist in the excesses
With excellence for evidence, necklaces for irrelevance
In the room, I'm the elephant, spellin' it for the hell of it
A-B-C-D-R-U-G-H-I-J-K-L-S-D

Oh my God
Baby, baby, don't you see? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got everything you need (Mula)
(O-only a genius could love a woman like she)
Oh my God
Baby, baby, don't you see? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got everything you need (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(O-o-only a genius could love a woman like she)

I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius (Genius, baby)
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
He's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A-B-C-D-R-U-G-H-I-J-K-L-S-D, ha

(Oh!)
You'll be my Einstein, my Newton, my Galileo, and my Hawkings
Boy, put that pep in my step
Put your arm on my neck while I am walkin'
Please understand, yeah, I have fallen for you, you
(What, what you say?)

Oh my God
Baby, baby, don't you see?
I got everything you need
(O-only a genius could love a woman like me)
Sayin', oh my God (My God)
Baby, baby, don't you see? (Yeah)
I got everything you need (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(O-o-only a genius could love a woman like me)

I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius (Genius, baby)
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
He's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
