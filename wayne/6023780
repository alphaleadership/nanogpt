39 ContributorsPerfect (Remix) Lyrics
Bitch, I did it, I made it, I'm loved and I’m hated
I started from the bottom, now my neighborhood is gated
They say, "Drink to your accomplishments," so every night I'm faded
Feel like every other day, me and somebody new related
You're my sister, cousin, brother from the other side? (The other side)
Well, I don’t know who told you that (My mama)
Well, she fucking lied
Ayy, wake up, wake up, get your cake up
Cut it up like it's cocaine, shake up
All the streets with all thеse beats
I body beats, I'm not discreet (Pеr-Per-Perfect)
This is how I feel on the inside
All you non-talent rappin' motherfuckers better run and hide
You worthless, you have no purpose, fuckin' imposter
You gots to get it through your head
You won't never get no handout
Fuckin' with your ass, it'd be like throwing a band out (Per-Per-Perfect)
My flow increased, my dough increased
You know I leave them all deceased
I am a fucking beast, I’m from the East
I keep the peace, don’t need a piece
But I keep a piece, got it, capisce?
That boy gon' eat, this is a feast
Once I release, I’m smokin' trees
I bought my shit, I don't need no lease
So fuck you up like Master P (Perfect)
This shit right here a masterpiece
I'm comin’ in hot like the police, shooting my shot like the police
All on the block like the police, man, who gon' (Stop, stop)
The police from leaving bodies in the motherfuckin' streets, man?
You might also like
Ooh-ooh, ahh
Man, fuck the police, when they come to my peeps
He put the hole in his cheek (Yeah!)
Gold on my teeth and my pockets obese
Like I got the get money disease (Right!)
I want my B's, I got more with the heat
When I speak, I put rappers to sleep (Yeah!)
When I get geeked, I go black on the beat
And I'm peeling them off of my cleats
Don't stand in my way, hope you offended today, okay
I got some Hannibal ways and I treat ‘em like dinner today, no way
I get to feeling the bass
And I'm saying my grace and I fuck around, bite off your face
Glock is not tucked on the waist
I just spit a sixteen and watch everyone duck in the place
Perfect, got a bad bitch that's perfect
Just bought a new crib, that's perfect
VVS in my JID, that's perfect
Got a billion streams, that's perfect
And a couple billboards, I'm perfect
See clowns in the game, circus
Red dot, all I know is I murk 'em, burn ‘em
Washing 'em all, detergent
Me and Nicki got a couple bitties twerking
Got a condo in the city full of Persians
And we got a tour bus full of virgins
Swervin, Murci' hit the curb and
Why you dumb rappers ain't learning?
Make it look good but ain't earning
All of your jewelry turning
I'm starting to get too concerning
I burnt up the track like a furnace
Been floating so long, I'm a star in the sky
And I start to forget what the Earth is (Fire)
Uh, I quarantine with a foreign ting
Gucci sweats with the drawstrings, eating X like soybeans
Smiling like I'm Paul Wall, sipping all this Pauline
She got a body like an RR, I sleep inside it like a RV
Gimme Adderall, gimme perc, fuck it, I'm still on full alert
I eat every pussy on Earth and still have room for dessert
I got porn stars on call, I got Warhol on the wall
Point a sawed-off at your skull (Bow) skull all on the wall
Catch your guard dog off guard
Get too fucking high, never fall hard
Cut the lights off in the RR
She look out the roof and see the Star Wars
And these diamonds got no flaws
That's flawless, all wins, no losses
Perfecto, that's foreign, Tunechi, de nada7Embed
