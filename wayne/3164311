Get a check, get another check
Flip another check, fuck a bitch
'Fore I fucked 'em all, I done fucked 'em all
Black Mercedes, in a drop-top coupe
That's how I bag them all, I swear to money
I need more

I need more, I need more, I need more, more (add it up)
I need more, I need more, I need more, more (add it up)
Yeah, yeah (I need more, I need more, I need more, more)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (I need more, I need more, I need more)

Walk up out that bank, cop up anything (uh, yeah)
Money ain't a thing, but I need more of that thing (I need more)
Yeah, the world need more like Wayne
Baby, what you think?
She said, "But, all you do is bang"
I said, "What you think?" (bang-bang-bang, yeah)
But I need more from her (yeah)
If she ain't fuckin', it's swerve (yeah)
'Cause I got more than her (yeah)
So be more alert (yeah), do more than twerk (yeah)
Get more bitches for daddy
Be more diverse, fuck more than me (yeah)
And do more to her (yeah)
I'm more unique when I do more than Percs
No more CMB (yeah), and, sure, it hurts (fuck it)
But I'm more complete, wish I knew more at first

The way I'm flowin', flowin', flowin', flowin'
They lookin' at me like a water fountain
The way I'm goin', goin', goin', goin'

I'm so up, yeah, I feel like I'm on the top floor
Life so dangerous, the Bible in the top drawer
One question: gotta tell me, would you die for it?
Ayy, go Forrest, to the money, run Forrest (yeah)
Hot boys, yeah, we really hot boys (yeah)
Your girl, yeah, she really not yours (ayy, ayy)
Got the key to the streets
Been pushin' so long, don't need a key
Got the key to the streets, yeah, yeah
If I lose this bitch then I'ma get another one
Treat her just the same, just like the other one
Get a check, get another check
Flip another check, fuck a bitch

I'm more elite 'cause I'm more at work

I did more than dirt, I ignored them words
'Cause that shit for the birds and I need more than birds (more)
