2 ContributorsHoller Lyrics
Ight, pay attention

I’m feelin’ like I’m trapped smack-dab in a cage
Wrapped in the rapture of the streets all day
I ain’t got chruch, I got work, but I’m saved
And I don’t know if this is how to behave, it make me wanna -
Holla
Burnin’ in the fire but I’m cold
Will I ever stop, bet my tires tell ya, “No”
I’m holdin’ down the spot, ‘cause bitch niggas hit the road, Fuck ‘em!
But I know real G’s never fold, it make me wanna -
Holla
Ridin’ in the city in a z0’
And now I keep it G, they play with any, I’m gone
And I don’t need a key, ‘cause when I’m here, I’m home My city!
Correct me if I’m wrong, oh, it make me wanna -
Holla
Hustlin’ in this mothafuckin’ hell
I’m all about my dough, anything else is unreal
I know I got ‘scale, but fuck I got bills
You don’t know why a nigga feel, it make me wanna -
Holla

Yeah, yeah
It go - gangsta, gangsta, steamer in the Sema
My flow Billie Jean, who feelin’ me?
Kill his team
We in the jungle, but gotta get that gorilla C.R.E.A.M
And for that squilla, we fight and kill-a, for real-a
By any means I got to get it, even if I spill it
That green, I gotta take it and feel it
Yeah that green we take it, place it in Phillies and lace it with sizzurp
We blaze it, they a be feelin’, don’t wanna be disturbed
You hatin’ homie, you get it?
Get yourself some work, and take yo’ bitch back, get yourself some err and holdin’ my skrrt
It’s Pimp Juice, from the same Thomas P.J.’s
Crawl over to the 17th Ward, been hard
Then I crawl to the east, and I balled in the east
Now talk ‘bout me, when they talk ‘bout the east
Nigga, call it like you see it, Weezy’s a young G
Came up on a hundie and flipped it to Young Money
