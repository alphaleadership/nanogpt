9 ContributorsDrivin ’Em Lyrics
Drivin in a Benz, burban Lexus
Coming through this motherfucker, turning motherfuckin necks
Going back in a superstretch
Just to see how many shy bitches I can catch
When I ride motherfucker you gon know
20s on the skinnies hanging out the window
Leather interior wood grain
18 inches woofers bought me so much pain
I'mma mac like Roley the one and only
Puff like daddy and im pretty like Tony
See the ho, bitch, shit
It's gotsta stop calico on the flo when a Ruger stay cocked
For the niggas in the night that call jack
With the tool imma fool, automatics click clack
I wanna fuck and how to fuck you bigger
Mama gonna dress ya and lord gon bless ya nigga
In the middle of the night it's hot
Call toll take a Frank mean yall to the spot
Cash Money rules everything around
If you represent U.P.T. or downtown

Bitch I thought ya knew they call me Baby
Hoes I drive them crazy
Money is a must, coke slanging
Plus I never duck when niggas bust in cars
I love many Benz, expeditions , hummers
They so pretty, and I fuck these hoes
Got a grill with a mouth full of golds
And Bitches know that I'm rich and dont take no shit
Notice lamborgini niggas that isnt shit
And I love these hoes that suck dick
Big Tymers for life it’s the shit
50 g's on my rolex From acorn
Sugar slim got the brains behind it homie
And It's so real nice with the ice
They call me Baby These bitches know my game is tight
You might also like
Who can file for most of the squash
Blast through the door and get your ass tossed
Every nigga on the map on acasion lose every nigga in them hallways
Nuthin but truth is behind the peace treaty is the best decision
Cuz you don't want them to hit cha bitcha
Me in the coop, ya'll in the hall
Ya'll on the crawl so I gots to ball
I'm in the yearbook
When I was at booker t party of the year 1993
My satisfaction is, I've never been a problem
See my advirsaries were suspended and I hide em
When I'm stuck in the club niggas will let you know
On the door start looking for sure
And if you want to start something
With my kliq it's cool cuz chop off all your dicks
Uptown baby the Big Tymers know where I live
The third door from the hum drums
Your dumb if want some rowdy boy we'll some
You won't see us in the tinted old car
Won'tcha ass be all fallin behind
But you got luck thats why you got behind
Time is running out for you fools
Chickens I was at your girls house with the lights out
And slash your fuckin leather
Get a seperate shit better, whether
Win, lose, or draw, still losing my clip
Cuz uptown for life is the motherfuckin shit
I'm the little one with the skrilla that's off the rilla
Cuz killas get punked on the start of pilas
Nigga it's me Hot Boy show
Head tilted to the right, I'll be right next store
Nigga you know me from the true store
I die slow cuz the bullets, are old
Niggas fall to the floor, ain't a slug to touch
Too bad little nigga say what
Your pants sagin and your head busts like a skittle
I'm on fire so they tried to chill it
Tell em dogg, ain't nothin gonna shake
Creep like a slave and take all the bait
Like a tape, I still rock the mack 10
110 bullets twirl like a whirlwind
I tie up your boy and rape your girlfriend
Come off the sex with the choppers twirlin in the wind
Better watch your children, are they all in?
I shoot twice, your crawling and I get disgusting
The beef get ugly, start busting going uhhh, up in
Jesus please come see us in the speeder
I jump out with gun in the freezer
Plus your boys won't go
They must of heard of Big Tymers, act like you know
Huh huh wha wha nigga1Embed
