4 ContributorsGirl You Know (BedRock) Lyrics
Young Money
Kane is in the building, nigga

Uhh, she got that good good, she Michael Jackson Bad
I'm attracted to her, with her attractive ass
You get her the matching bags
I get her to pack them bags
Get straight in that taxi cab
Come straight to my bachelor pad
I hate to see her go, but I love to watch her leave
But I bet she coming back, like she forgot her keys
And now we murderers because we kill time
She saw Dr. Carter and now she feel fine

I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that red bull now let's fly away
Lets buy a place, With all kinds of space
I'll let you be the judge, And and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, No Stevie Wonder
She don't even wonder, cuz she know she bad
And I got her nigga, grocery bag
You might also like
Look, look at you (at you)
Bad, yes you are
She roll with us
Look at how she walks
I like the way you talk
Girl you know, Girl you know
Yeah she know it, Yeah she know it
You're so, you know
You're so, you know

Ok I get it, let me think, I guess its my turn
Maybe its time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prolly right
He pressing me like button downs on a Friday night
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, Be on my egg whites
You say Nicki don't stop you the bestest
And I just be coming off the top asbestos

I love your sushi roll, Hotter than Wasabi
I race for your love, Shake and bake Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W but I can't meet you at the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back cuz I’m not just anybody
I see em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston, and let the rest surprise her
Cos when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh that was you girl, I thought I recognized her

Look, look at you (at you) Bad, yes you are
She roll with us
Look at how she walks, I like the way you talk
Girl you know, Girl you know
Yeah she know it, Yeah she know it
You're so, you know
You're so, you know

She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romancing, I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscious is
She watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when the shows ends she all in my skin
Lotions, no emotions, rollercoastin' like back forth
Hold it (hold it, hold it, hold it)
She pose like its for posters
And I poke like I'm supposed to
Take this photo if you for me
Don't you ever show this
I'm too loyal, and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this she rejoiced it
Tell your words, get me open
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment
Uh, She a'int got a man, but she is not alone
Miss Independent, yeah she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um uh I mean flawless
Well that's what you are, how I see it
Is how I call it, yeah
Look at how she walk
Mm hmm, she know she bad
Do your thing baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain't leavin fast, Imma stay awhile
Hold your head Chris, Imma Take Her Down

Look, look at you (at you)
Bad, yes you are
She roll with us
Look at how she walks
I like the way you talk
Girl you know, Girl you know
Yeah she know it, Yeah she know it
You're so, you know
You're so, you know know

Gudda Gudda
T Streets
Mack Maine
Jae Millz
Tyga
Drizzy Drake
Nicki Minaj
Hey Shanell

Look, look at you (at you)
Bad, yes you are
She roll with us
Look at how she walks
I like the way you talk
Girl you know, Girl you know
Yeah she know it, Yeah she know it
You're so, you know
You're so, you know knowEmbed
