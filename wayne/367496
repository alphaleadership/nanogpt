5 ContributorsThey Love The S-Q-A-D (Bounce 4 Rage) Lyrics
Hustle for S-Q, hustle for S-Q, wobble for S-Q
Hustle for S-Q, hustle for S-Q

You know them hoes love Weezy, I'm a dog with it
And if ya bitch scream Sqad we can all hit it
I make her work it from behind and catch a wall with it
And then she rock-rock the boat
And walk with it, walk the- walk with it
I run it in the hole like Marshall Faulk with it
I put it in ya mouth, hoe can you talk with it
I'm off the chain, right
And if you red and big fine then you Wayne tight
Yeah, and Weezy'll fuck friends, boy ain't right
And yall like a lil' pussy, but you give brain, right? Right
See she ain't never had a Sqad boy, slash a Hot Boy
Plus the number one, bitch I'm Stunna son
And I just wanna see you hustle to the floor
And I don't wanna see you back that azz up that shit old
I'm like, oh, oh, oh in ya mouth
And when I bust a nut I holla, "Ahhhh"

I'm for the Sqad hoe, I'm for the Sqad bitch
She like the Sqad though, she love the Sqad shit
And if you lookin' for her you know where she be
With S-Q-A-D
I'm for the Sqad hoe, I'm for the Sqad bitch
She like the Sqad though, she love the Sqad shit
And if you lookin' for her you know where she be
With S-Q-A-D

Now hold on, let me get my chain 'cause it hang so long
Ain't so grown, but the game so strong
Hoe won't lemme fuck 'cause my thang so long
But as soon as she give me brain so long
Don't let the game zone then the skank go home
Anyways you stankin' up my ozone
You see me on the 'Zant every all day
Pass all the halfway oh and please back ya dame up off me, fall
Get it man introducing ya bitch to Nut'll fuck up ya wedding plans
I'm a veteran, y'all laggin'
Y'all niggas rookies in this game me and my dawgs all madden
Y'all niggas acting like y'all action
We all pack MAC-10's that a give ya whole damn back in
We leave the club, I pull up ya hoe walk back and
Fall it, that's what I call mackin' understand it

I'm for the Sqad hoe, I'm for the Sqad bitch
She like the Sqad though, she love the Sqad shit
And if you lookin' for her you know where she be
With S-Q-A-D
I'm for the Sqad hoe, I'm for the Sqad bitch
She like the Sqad though, she love the Sqad shit
And if you lookin' for her you know where she be
With S-Q-A-D
I got a suite with a hoe inside, a suite with some dro inside
A bottle with momo inside, it's time to go inside
It's Sqad up, throw it high
And I'd like to take a brief moment of silence, my flow jus died, shh
And I'm so damn fly
No, ma'am, I don't hold hands, I just get that throat and ride
See I quickly fuck a bitch and forget her
Yeah baby, a higher empire like No Limit Records
And I'm not a minute man but I could fuck you for so many seconds
And with them seconds I split in a split second, get what you see impressive
I like it when you thick with big breasts
I like it when you quick to get breakfast
And I just wanna see you pop it my way
You not a independent woman, bitch you not Beyonc√©
And this mami do me or she wanna do is chew me
And when I bust a nut I holla, "Ooh wee"

I'm for the Sqad hoe, I'm for the Sqad bitch
She like the Sqad though, she love the Sqad shit
And if you lookin' for her you know where she be
With S-Q-A-D
I'm for the Sqad hoe, I'm for the Sqad bitch
She like the Sqad though, she love the Sqad shit
And if you lookin' for her you know where she be
With S-Q-A-DEmbed
