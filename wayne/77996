7 ContributorsWhat Your Girl Like Lyrics
I know what girls like (Ayy), I know what they want (Ayy)

Chris, I got you, uh

Okay, Weezy F, baby, Polo horses on my underwear
Baby, I'm a beast, ooh, your boyfriend a gummy bear
We-Well, can I at least put some kisses on you under there?
Ma-Man, it ain't my fault I want you badder than some fuckin' air
Hundred millionaire, I'll take you anywhere
I'll put a ring on it and make you really care
Now what's really good? It-It's Young Moolah, baby
Yeah, guns and roses and tulips, baby
Ha, I do this, baby, now come and do it with me
Because I'm right, I'm right like a New Amendment, ha
Now I'm right with your ass
And if you fall in love after tonight, it's your bad, yeah

She like it over here, she like the way I do it
She wanna lay it back, so I put her on to it

And shawty like the boss, so I let her swipe the Visa
