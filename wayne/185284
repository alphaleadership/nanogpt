7 ContributorsHow To Love (Remix) Lyrics
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

When you was just a young’un you’re looks but so precious
But now you’re grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can’t have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It’s seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You might also like
I just want to take my time
I just want to do my thing
Maybe we press rewind
Maybe I buy that ring
We could grow old together
Just share our soul together
Find out how to love, kiss and hug
How to roll together
I just need you by my side
Baby we could be alright
I just want to hold you right
We could go into the night
You're the one I need

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault
Wasn’t in your intentions
You the one here talking to me
You don’t want to listen
But I admire your popping bottles and dipping
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
I just want you to know1Embed
