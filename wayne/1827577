7 ContributorsHeard â€™Em All Remix Lyrics
Let me freshen up, ahh
Okay, I just want to love every girl in the world
Take her to the Moon, then take her to the room
Posted up chilling, looking how I'm feeling
It's Miss Amerie and Mr. A Millie
Smelling like money, it's probably Young Money
Usain Wayne, I make her run from me
Crew neck tee, all black chuckers
Weezy F B, the girls dem lover
And if it ain't me then the girls just suffer
I got the big bread so the girls just butter
And you ain't gotta love me 'cause the world do
And I ain't gotta do me 'cause ya girl do
Miss Amerie, took a lil' time out
Bugatti sit so low, you gotta climb out
Bring it back, bring it back
I blow your spine out
Hehe, get the handicap sign out

I done heard 'em all talk 'bout how much they want me
But ain't never had nobody put it on me, hey!
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
You might also like
Some of them wonder what it take to be my lover (Yeah)
First you gotta be my drummer, don't move fast
You can pop tags on the Louis bags
But it won't get you under my covers

(Girls) Ah-ah, oh-oh, eh-eh, oh yeah
(Girls) Ah-ah, oh-oh, eh-eh, oh yeah

I done heard 'em all talk 'bout how much they want me
But ain't never had nobody put it on me, hey!
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
I done heard 'em all talk 'bout how much they want me
But ain't never had nobody put it on me, hey!
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Keep it!
(Hey!) Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
(Hey!) Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Keep it!
(Hey!) Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
(Hey!) Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
You asked me to let you explain (I done that)
Same talk, same game, same thing (done-done that)
I need a Kingston feature
That will never run when the dance floor, heat up (I don't wanna heat up)

(Girls) Ah-ah, oh-oh, eh-eh, oh yeah
(Girls) Ah-ah, oh-oh, eh-eh, oh yeah (Ah!)

I done heard 'em all talk 'bout how much they want me
But ain't never had nobody put it on me, hey!
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
I done heard 'em all talk 'bout how much they want me
But ain't never had nobody put it on me, hey!
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Keep it!
(Hey!) Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
(Hey!) Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Keep it!
(Hey!) Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
(Hey!) Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Sometimes (Sometimes)
I want a man to make me feel (Oh, make me feel)
What I really need to feel (What I need to feel)
But do you really know what I want this time?
But sometimes (Sometimes, I)
I wanted you to know what it is
'Cause lately what I've been gettin'
Ain't so real, so real, so real

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Keep it!
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me (Hey!)
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Keep it!
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me (Hey!)
Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me

Yes Sir, the international queen has returned! (Woo!)
You heard Amerie! (Woo!)1Embed
