50 ContributorsKey To The Streets (Remix) Lyrics
Yeah, 2 Chainz, whoa
Think It's A Game

I got the keys to the Wraith
Inside look like outer space, ugh, ugh
I had a meal with no plate
I take myself out on dates, ugh, ugh
I got the key to the mansion
Ho call my phone, I don't answer
I fuck a bitch on a Banshee
My chandelier'll start dancing, ugh, ugh
I got the key to the Maybach
I got the key to the Phantom, ugh, ugh
I got a .38 special
It got black tape 'round the handle, ugh, ugh
I got a lock on my shoe
That's a Buscemi pattern, yeah
Rest in peace, Johnny
Man, he had more keys than Khaled, yeah, whuh
All of my flows is violent
All of my hoes is solid
All of my hoes is naughty
When they expose their body
They got a pole beside it
Don't need no clothes beside it
All of my hoes excited
If you got gas, then light it
Got you a case? Then fight it
Empty the safe deposit, ugh, ugh!
You might also like
I got money way before the deal (Yeah, ayy)
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
Oh-ho-ho-whoa, I might fuck your ho and pay her bills (Ayy)
Yeah, we was taught to get it how we live (Oh), yeah
I got your ho on a leash
Got a plug, he Vietnamese (Yeah, yeah)
We the niggas they wanna be
Cause we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets (Yeah)
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets, yeah, yeah (Oh)

We got key, we got key, we got key, nigga (Oh-ho-ho)
Put some extra on it, make your partner bleed with him, hey
When it's extra on it, it ain't guaranteed, nigga (Oh-ho, oh, oh)
I put some extra on it, can't believe I sold it
I'm a gangsta and your bitch, she love that (She love that)
Lookin' at my ankle, I'm like, "Where the love at?" Yeah, hey
I've been juugin' since a fuckin' rugrat, you probably was a rat
Snitch, I've been closin' deals way before the rap
Bakin' soda wrapped, huh (Oh), tryna get a big amount, huh
Niggas lying, talkin' bout key, can't even get around, hey
Niggas lying, talkin' bout key, keychain don't make a sound
I need my crown, nigga, I'm talkin' Nino Brown, nigga, yeah
I got money way before the deal (Yeah, hey)
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
Oh-ho-ho-whoa, I might fuck your ho and pay her bills (Ayy)
Yeah, we was taught to get it how we live (Oh), yeah
I got your ho on a leash (Oh)
Got a plug, he Vietnamese (Yeah, yeah)
We the niggas they wanna be
'Cause we got the key to the streets (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets, yeah, yeah

I told my bitch I'd get her a Birkin bag
I had no idea that shit was thirty bands
Fuck the record deal, I got sex appeal
Lit like an electric eel, fat rims, anorexic wheels
I got the key to the streets on my keychain
Like "Jang-a-lang, jang-a-lang"
Niggas naming names, doing anything for a famous name
And these hoes the same
We were supposed to change since Dr. King
"We shall overcome"â€”we never overcame
I take over the game, and if you think it's a game (Think It's A Game)
Then it's all about the final score of the game
I put my woe in the game
I put my ho on the 'caine, now we fuck more
Gave my daughter the game, niggas all the same
And I done broke every heart but yours
I just pulled off from the gun store in the Azure
With something that'll make you tuck yours
I got the keys to the streets
But I don't need nothing but my feet for your front door, lil' daddy
'Cause I'm Illmatic, I'm still at it
Now she lookin' at it
Now she lookin' at me, fly her to Miami
Now the bitch tanning, now she looking khaki
I'm looking for it, purple Acti'
I'ma sip it like a virgin daiquiri
In Cuba with my nigga, Dirty Harry
Walk a fine line with sturdy banisters
Got birdies landin', got murderers handy
I'ma take a power nap
'Cause I done got so comfy in the trap, I forgot I rap
Plus I'm on so much shit, my insides feel like a lava lamp
Aim right at your collar-flap
You better tighten your bottle cap, little nigga
I got money way before the deal (Yeah)
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
Oh-ho-ho-whoa (Oh), I might fuck your ho and pay her bills
Yeah, we was taught to get it how we live, yeah
I got your ho on a leash
Got a plug, he Vietnamese
We the niggas they wanna be
'Cause we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets, yeah, yeah (Oh)6Embed
