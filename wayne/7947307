1 ContributorReady Lyrics
Oh shit
I been tryna kick my shit to Jalen Rose, bitch
Field goal missed, fuck it, that some old shit
We love when old shit smell like fuckin’ roses
I need my nose fixed
Shuffle cards, go fish
Fuck a fast ball, I’m waitin’ on a slow pitch
You in need of love, lookin’ for a whole pimp
I got a trigger tongue, double barrel, both lips
I’m talkin’ brrrr
Sounded like a whole clip
Whole trip
I am on a whole trip
You probably fucked my road dog while I am on a road trip
I’m in need of some more love, she in need of some more tips
I’ma make a snowball out a bunch of cold chicks
My love is so lit but I ain’t lovin’ no bitch
That’s what I tell myself, but it go in and out of both ears
Got me talkin’ to the mirror, conversation so real
I tired of bein’ alone, nigga, tell me how you really feel

I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready, I’m ready
If you ask me, I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m read-I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m
You might also like
Oh shit
I’m so sick and you actin’ like a dosage, with no fix
Tryna take you where your soul wish, when your toes click
Friends hatin’, you can post this and write “We posted in Neverland when the weather bad, tryna get a tan”
Got me thinkin’ ‘bout your ring finger on your helping hand
Got me feelin’ like a queen make a king a better man
I’m so tired of bein’ alone, get your shit together man
I’m just sayin’ baby

I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready, I’m ready
If you ask me, I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m read-I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m
(Mannie Fresh on the motherfuckin’ beat)

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take itEmbed
