38 ContributorsF.I.V.E. Lyrics
Prosecutor: Sir, is it true you were a crack cocaine dealer for seven years?
Defendant: I-I plead the fifth
Prosecutor: Exactly how much money did you earn in your time as a crack cocaine dealer?
Defendant: Fifth, five. One, two, three, four, Fifth

Joggin' my memory, the Documentary
Killed that in a drop top, John Kennedy
Had the rap game in fear, like it was ten of me
The old me ain't got shit on where I'm finna be
Nigga, I'm finna be still reppin' the letter B
What if it was the nigga that Dre signed instead of me?
Would I be starvin' or studyin' in Harvard?
Or would I be a dog of another fuckin' pedigree?
Take away me, take away the su-woo
Take away the Gang Starr like hip-hop did Guru
Pull up in that new coupe, take away your girl, run her choo-choo
Then put it on WorldStar or YouTube
Yo, Tune', what it do?
Got some bitches in the lobby and I'm 'bout to send them through
I'm Kobe rings, nigga, who the fuck is you?
Not the nigga with five bitches sittin' in the coupe

Five
Got Jacksons in my pocket and I'm feelin' like a Jackson
Five
I'm ballin', yeah, I'm ballin', got me feelin' like I'm in the Fab 5
For as long as I live, I will rep the five
Like MJ in game five, oh-woah
See The Game LiveGet tickets as low as $163You might also like
I got five on it,
Five sho', Young Tune' in this bitch, fuck 5-0
Nickel plated .45 if I have an issue
Beat your ass black and blue with a bag of nickels, ha
I'm a G, do somethin' 'bout it
You ain't half of me, you need five hundred dollars, nigga
And my redbone 5'5"
No hand slapped, but I'm high five
Yeah, get with the game or play the sideline
I dream to get the cover of High Times
Now take five paces
And try to guess the color of my shoelaces, red, bitch
Yeah, I'm on my high horse
Now the sky mad at me 'cause I stole five stars
Got some freaks in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' 'til five in the morn'

Five (I got, haha)
Got Jacksons in my pocket and I'm feelin' like a Jackson (Yeah, Young Tunechi, feelin' like the Jackson Five)
Five
I'm ballin', yeah, I'm ballin' (Woo-hoo), got me feelin' like I'm in the Fab 5  (Young moolah, baby)
For as long as I live I will rep the five (Five)
Like MJ in game five, oh-woah
I deserve to be top five
Shots, pull up7Embed
