10 ContributorsStill Lyrics
Uh, trust fund, baby, lump sums, baby
Got a bunch of 'em, baby, not some money, baby
Got much money, baby
Brrp brrp, the money comin', baby
By the dump truck, baby
Young Money, baby, tryna' fuck someone, baby
Boutta run something, baby
I'm over here havin' too much fun, baby
That ho dreamin' havin' my trust fund, baby
Gotta suck something, baby
What's up, baby?
What that talk 'bout? Run that tongue for me, baby
Yeah, give me some head for some bread
Ooh, that's lunch money, baby
Rich nigga screamin' out, "Fuck money, baby"
Like what money, baby?
Blood gang, baby, that's blood money, baby
Love got her own money, love money, baby
Laughin' to the bank now, they don't know what's funny, baby
Tell 'em hush, lil baby, I don't trust nothing, baby
Fuck that shit, I'll bust one, baby
Got a few guns baby, not onе gun, baby
Need two cups baby, not one cup, baby
You done blew up baby, I donе fucked already
But we could keep that between just us, baby
Shh I done said too much, huh, baby?
Frrr, I done made too much, huh, baby?

Still in the coupe goin' crazy (Goin brazy)
Not a Vette, it's a Lamb', baby (It's a Lamb', babe)
Blockin' these bitches like spam, baby (Like spam, babe)
Swipin' my card, I got scams, baby (Like scams, babe)

I'm a real deal boss, ain't no damn comparin'
Half a million Plain Pateks, I don't even wear 'em
Fuck her from the back and smack it
Good pussy, I'm a addict
Bought a Benz and then she matte it
Lunch money, I'm her daddy
Throw it back, she got a fatty
Baby mama get a new Benz
Came with my chopper, I got no friends
It's a triple stack, I was rollin'
Pop a pill and break her back in
These niggas be actin' (Actin')
Tell your bitch 'cause you really were lackin'
I ain't stressed out, I'm really relaxin'
Pinky armour, money be stackin'
Young nigga tryna catch a Kardashian
Drop off baby then I end up crashin'
Can't love a ho, I'ma end up passin'
In the coupe goin' crazy like still
Young nigga, Fresh Prince like Will, for real
Still in the coupe goin' crazy (Goin brazy)
Not a Vette, it's a Lamb', baby (It's a Lamb', babe)
Blockin' these bitches like spam, baby (Like spam, babe)
Swipin' my card, I got scams, baby (Like scams, babe)
I pull up with Tunechi like Weezy, baby (Weezy, baby)
