3 ContributorsLike Glue Lyrics
But I don't really care what security say
I don't give a fuck what them waan do
All I know me sticks to mi gun like glue
And me I'm not be 'fraid ta shoot
All i know that weezy ain't never scared
Bust a lotta buck shot in your head
Later bach it man down him there dead
Now we must relaaax

So go - they on me like the boy and tha wussy pussy
Before the Glock out, tha Glock then go blocky-blocky
Gun shot back shot - bullet out and now you crucked crucked
And then im in the last time before you tooky tooky
Tha hot boy go ta burn your city city
If you go try me - put a hole in your fitted fitted
Me knock tha posee - we dont cure about no sissy sissy
In erey way we hold it down - my niggas with me with me
Tha young money boys in tha crew - SQ
Without a no worried attitude - do you
We out here hustlin for the loot - so true
And if you interfere then you get played like a fool

But I don't really care what security say
I don't give a fuck what them waan do
All I know me sticks to mi gun like glue
And me I'm not be 'fraid ta shoot
All i know that weezy ain't never scared
Bust a lotta buck shot in your head
Later bach it man down him there dead
Now we must relaaax

So come test - watch out for - weezy go up in chest
The ak-47 leave a smitherin mess
And ahh yes - yes we steady puffin on stress
Big up ta 81 - forget tha suasy inta vest

And she call me erey minute cuz she wants for me ta hit it

And she know im a guerilla
But she not scared of a killer

Ereytime your gal is in my mind
Ya need ta git it on tha line
And kick off tha hoe all tha time

But I don't really care what security say
I don't give a fuck what them waan do
All I know me sticks to mi gun like glue
And me I'm not be 'fraid ta shoot
All i know that weezy ain't never scared
Bust a lotta buck shot in your head
Later bach it man down him there dead
Now we must relaaax
Some guy - lil leighter decide ta disrespect me
And when me out the pully tec
I done did reject him
Sometimes he never wanna put this slug in ya jacket
But nigga all haters - ima make them respect it
So pleez - yount wanna beef
Me cock back uzi

You fuckn with an army
We all got big guns tuck by the tummy
Me back you no last
We sit you on yo ass
The pistols blast more fire on yo ass
Ya better move fast
Git left in a bag
We all are strapped
Yount even gatta ask
So once again

But I don't really care what security say
I don't give a fuck what them waan do
All I know me sticks to mi gun like glue
And me I'm not be 'fraid ta shoot
All i know that weezy ain't never scared
Bust a lotta buck shot in your head
Later bach it man down him there dead
Now we must relaaax
But I don't really care what security say
I don't give a fuck what them waan do
All I know me sticks to mi gun like glue
And me I'm not be 'fraid ta shoot
All i know that weezy ain't never scared
Bust a lotta buck shot in your head
Later bach it man down him there dead
Now we must relaaax
