55 ContributorsSleazy (Remix 2.0) - Get Sleazier Lyrics
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

Uh, uh
Okay, I'm young and I’m tatted, I get them bucks like a addict
Rockin' this Christian Dior, I spend so much on my fabric
I got a wifey at home, and what she wants, she can have it
And she in love with my stick, she say I work it like magic
Okay, now, no need to panic, I'm on a beach where the sand is
Somewhere smokin' on medication, no, I won't need a bandage
Some would look at my age and try to say I'm young and I'm handsome
I say I'm filthy fuckin' rich, so I'm a ol' dirty bastard
And my crib's a disaster, and my kush is the master
I was in my yellow car, but my Ferrari go faster
Soundin' like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers
On the remix with Ke$ha, 'bout out to go see the cashier
On the grind, so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it
I look down and see a hundred thou' and think, "It's time to get it"
Brought a lot of marijuana and I'm here to share it
No, it’s not a problem, better get it then, I won't be here tomorrow, lil' mama
Tahahahahaha!

I don't need you or your brand new Benz

I don't need you or your brand new Benz

And I don't need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

We start out so cute in our baby pictures
That Mama shot for our daddy, so that he wouldn't forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he'll remember
If not, he's human, I'm human, you human, we'll forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how Mama hates him
He's such a cool-ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I'm only eight, I'm not old enough, guess it's complicated
Two-parent dwellings, expellin' have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it don't get negated
I was gon' save it for later, "but later" look like "maybe"
This crazy lady named Ke$ha is guessin' my Mercedes
Would be all new and frou-frou, but it's a 1980s
But now that we are cool-cool, she sippin' Irish Baileys
She say, "Stacks, you’re true-blue?" I said, "Nah, I’m navy"
I call her "Keisha," she like it because it's hood to her
She call me "André 6000" because I'm good to her
I don’t need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
And I don’t need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

Well, damn
Hey Ke$ha, what up, boo? It's me
Do you know what to do wit me?
Bad bitches, I got two with me
Witk you, better make it "two or three"
Bad bitches know me, so don't bother introducin' me
They want me more than diamonds
Wipe me down bitch, I’m super clean
I’m hella cold, mega paid, makin' moves, doin' things
Bitches stay queued, and they all wanna do the king
I’m boiling, royalty, knew it when I seen her
I was gonna take her, make her my new royal penis cleaner
My demeanor something special, and this dick is so impressive
Bitch, I bet you'd take it off and take it with you if I let you
I ain't trippin’, I’m just here, they couldn’t catch you, and I got you
Bitch, my swag on supernatural, get you pregnant lookin' at you
I ain't nothing like them other dudes
I’m an atom bomb, they a molecule
Still paid, ballin’ out the frame, stuntin’ like a fool
I don’t need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don’t need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat, gonna make me come (um-um-um...)
Over to your place
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat, gonna make me come (um-um-um...)
Over to your place

Ugh, we be on that shit that no one be on, that's what we on
Smoke that neon, Kings of Leon, dynamite, Napoleon
Got some skinnies and a T on and some Vans
And my mans got the ratchet
While I'm laying in some pussy, you'll be laying in a casket
I'm just sayin', I'm just spazzin', I'm just smashin', I'm just nasty
If you 'bout it, bust it open, oh, you fancy
Man, I got so many flows like a mansion, catch a tantrum
Know a girl named Cleopatra, she a-throw that pussy at ya
I'm financially straight like a line, I ain't lyin'
And all my hoes on they toes, ballerina, Black Swan
And we on that Ciroc, Grey Goose, Pat-rón
It's Weezy, baby; Sleazy, baby, yeah!

I don’t need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don’t need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds (Young Mula, baby!)
I don’t need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don’t need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds
