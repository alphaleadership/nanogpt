You know this ain't a game to us

My future's lookin' promisin'
Problem with my mom again, troublin'
Money thinks it's runnin' things
When no income isn't comin' in
Runnin' with the wrong again
Gone again, money

I keep sendin' cash demeanor
Got it, workin' for it meaner
Puts a hurtin' on a senior
Have to curtain, cook and pee on
Did I stutter? It's root of all, boo, all you loyal to it, useless
Bruise tryna do vocal, lose no one
I still pull him out a grave
Tryna play, chap? Okay
Dust him off, nobody's touchin' us and rush him off
Loose lips, Rick dances with wolf, kid
Elusive, arrange is the new black, I move past
Like, "Dress me like some baby George Clinton," what's he thinkin'?
Stackin' the deck, ain't attractin' a chick, ain't backin' up shit
Control money, don't let it show money
Soul money, never let it go from me, cold, homie
Suede, linen, ain't decay, pray when I'm A in 'em
Stay with him, told to play, ageism
"Variety makes good society," I said this
Respect, kid
Excessive makes me question my ethics
Though cash has no moral comp', showin' some
Flow is don, know it's wrong, throw it from, showin' some
Home, sweet home
You might also like
Like some new cents in my wallet
I'm on top it and nurturing the loose change in my pocket
You know this ain't a game to us
Money, money thinks—

Money versus everybody, money isn't everything
That's cap and I put that on everything
I don't look back, I never blink
I'm at the bank, I'm thinkin' 'bout the fact how I don't have to think
About a way to rob the bank
I fuck around and buy the bank
Dollar bill, dollar bill, water bill, power bill
Power struggles, power moves, and power drills 'cause I reveal
I gotta ball, gotta plot, got a wall full of clocks
Still ain't got no time to kill, got on a watch, the diamonds real
Money make the world go 'round, money racin' hurdles now
Take the drapes, the curtains down, don't money make the perfect clouds?
Money counter go, "Brr," money make the perfect sound
And the chopper go, "Brr-rrr-rrr-rrr," okay, they heard me now
Lookin' like a pile of money, that ho face-first in the pile
This that Tunechi and Preemo, we connect like a magnet
And we grew to Magneto like the root of all evil, money

My future's lookin' promisin'
Problem with my mom again, troublin'
Money thinks it's runnin' things
When no income isn't comin' in
Runnin' with the wrong again
Gone again, money
When ponderin' a con again
Morality in front of when or once again
Money thinks it's runnin' things
See you got a honey, young and thin
Buy the honey ton of things
Flatterin', money2Embed
