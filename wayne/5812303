We was gettin' money, tryna rack that cash up
This the type of money that'll back that ass up (Yeah)
Don't be actin' funny when you clap that ass up
Shorty, you better not act up

Pistols in the party, nigga (Bah), I can feel the tension (Ayy)
They don't want us in the hood like a fucked up engine
Bitch, if you can't take the heat, get out my muhfuckin' kitchen (Bitch)
Ayy, shout out all my shooters, couple names I can't mention
When your mama told you stay away from the gang, you shoulda listened (Ayy)
When I wake up in the mornin', all I'm thinkin' 'bout is checking
Wack a nigga then I'm tourin', shoulda kept me out your (Gang, gang)
Pull up on my opps, we got 'em sick as hell, that nigga tellin'

He wasn't cuttin' it, that lil' baby need some bigger dick (Ayy)
That's a thirty, this a fifty, this a bigger stick (This a bigger stick)
Popped a Perky, now a nigga feelin' sick as shit (Feelin' sick as shit)
Just made the flip and shit, my niggas gettin' rich as shit
She actin' innocent, but she ain't really innocent (Damn)
I just caught another bag, made five in a hour
Niggas love gettin' bags (Bitch), I make five in the shower (Yuh)
In the mall poppin' tags, spending bags by the thousand
Who them niggas gettin' that? Bitch, don't ask 'cause they around us
Kickin' doors and throwin' up pounds of steel, walkin' with the choppas still
Got it on me walking out the pharm', I got a lotta pills
Got it on me walking out the bank, I got a lotta bills
Old hundreds, sippin' old red, show you how I feel
I don't trust 'em, that's a code red, show me how it sip (Nah)
Hundred bitches at the hotel, we got the lobby filled
I don't trust 'em, that's a code red, show me how it sip
Hundred bitches at the hotel, we got the lobby filled

Yeah, that kitty cat, give me that
I'm the type of nigga break your back then run it back
Pussy soakin' on my fuckin' lap, she love the dad
I'ma hit it, make him fuckin' mad, I make a mess
She a muhfuckin' get it girl, so get it, girl
I'm that nigga, that nigga-nigga that hit it, girl6Embed
