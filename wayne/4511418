18 ContributorsBoiling Water Lyrics
That's that Milly Rock, boy, hah, nigga
Get your MAC, boy
Ayy, let's go (What up?)
Ah (Weezy, what up?)
Woo, can't feel, woo (Yeah, practice)

Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (Watch it lock, boy)
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (Watch it rock, boy)
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (This that Milly Rock, boy)
Ugly, but I'm handsome in the yacht (Woo)
Ugly, but I'm handsome in the trap (Woo)
Ugly, but they throwin' me the box (Woo)
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (In the pot, boy)
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (This that Milly Rock, boy)

Forever livin' ruthless
I could build an empire off of cookie, call me Lucious (Yeah), uh
I'm gettin' money, no assumin', no excuses (None)
My traphouse metro boomin' (Boomin', boomin')
Haters never wanna see you get your eat on (Nah)
Up in Philippe with that Patek on (Patek Philippe)
I ain't Pablo, but I'm Honcho (Honcho)
Bruce Leroy, boy, how I glow, uh (Glow)
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot, ho
Mama said, "What you doin'?" I'm just cookin' pot roast
Soon as she turned her back, I winked my eye, though
Your bitch wanna fuck me, so I kill that pussy, John Doe, woah
Doors up on that 'Lago (Up)
Extra cargo, trunk full of narcos (Yup)
That water lift it, I could whip it while the jar float (Whip it)
I keep a Glock, more dough than the pizza shop (Ayy)

Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (Tru, in the pot, boy)
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (2 Chainz, Milly Rock, boy)

If I ever spoke it, then it's magnum opus
I just put a scope on it just to focus (Bah, bah)
Hopeless like a penny with a hole in it
Might slide home in the third inning
Come back around like a tornado
Told shawty I don't kiss below navels
Red carpet, GRAMMY suit was all navy
Yeah, used to have the 'caine like an old lady, yeah
Watch it Harlem Shake in the pyrex
My success may be hard for some to digest
Told Steve Kerr that I got next
Fuckin' with me like eatin' soup with the chopsticks (Yeah)
Hahaha, you can't do it
Slick as Havoline, I speak trapanese fluent
On the trampoline, I flip backwards, you ain't do it
In the courtroom starin' at the jury, wearin' jewelry, yeah
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (Watch it lock, boy)
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (Watch it rock, boy)
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (This that Milly Rock, boy)
Ugly, but I'm handsome in the yacht (Woo)
Ugly, but I'm handsome in the trap (Woo)
Ugly, but they throwin' me the box (Woo)
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (In the pot, boy)
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (This that Milly Rock, boy)

Boilin' water dancin' in the pot
And my Audemar dancin', check my watch
My skinny corduroy pants is full of guap
And the party's gettin' crashed, and we don't knock
Just some Mardi Gras masks and some locks, uh
Phone charger wrapped around the opp, yeah
Chrome point exactly at his mop, yeah
Somebody yelled, "Action," and I shot him
At a foam party, splashin' at a thot, yeah
Her boyfriend passionate, I'm not, damn
My calls get canceled, never dropped
And I'm Bone Thugs, faster than the cops
Styrofoam cups, Actavis, and pop
And a few prescription passes from the doc'
Had a few collision crashes, didn't stop, yeah
Movin' soft out the hardtop
Traphouse pumpin' like the Hard Rock
Pills got me feelin' like the stars dropped
Credit card pumpin' when your heart stop
Packs in my broad route
And I'm boilin' water, lookin' at the clock, it's the rock
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (Watch it lock, boy)
Ugly, but I'm handsome in the yacht (Watch it rock, boy)
Ugly, but I'm handsome in the trap (This that Milly Rock, boy)
Ugly, but they throwin' me the box  (Woo)
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (Woo)
Boilin' water dancin' in the pot (Woo)3Embed
