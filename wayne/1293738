4 ContributorsDown LyricsBaby are you down down down down down
(Down, Down, )
Even if the sky is falling down
(Down down, )
You ought to know
Tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show
I wanna see how you lose control
So leave it behind cause we have a night to get away
So come on fly with me as we make our great escape

So baby don't worry you were my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'd be my only no need to worry
Baby are you down down down down down
(Down, Down)
Baby are you down down down down down
(Down, Down)
Even if the sky is falling down
Just let it be
Come on bring your body next to me
I'll take you away
Turn this place into our private getaway
So leave it behind cause we have a night to get away
So come on fly with me as
We make our great escape so why don't we run away

Like she suppose to be
She is down all over me
Down like her temperature cause to me she is zero degrees
She cold over freeze I got that girl overseas
Now she's my listenary
Now can I be her soldier please
I'm fighting for this girl on the battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby cupid sending arrows from above
Don't you ever leave the side of me
And definitely, now probably
And honestly, I'm down like the economy
