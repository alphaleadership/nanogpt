1 ContributorHow to Love Lyrics
Cut The music up
A lil' louder
Yeah

You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
Its hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Never had a love

When you was just a young’un you’re looks were so precious
But now you're grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can’t have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It’s seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you’re sitting here, here in this corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
You might also like
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you acting
Like you never had a love
Had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault
Wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me
Be the one listening
But I admire your heart and good intentions
Just as much as you admire my strength and my instincts
Baby, so don't be mad
Nobody else trippin
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love

See I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeah
And I want you to know, you're far from the usual
Far from the usual

You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
Yeah
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
