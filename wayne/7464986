17 ContributorsNat King Cole (Unlocked) Lyrics
So unforgettable
More than incredible
More than a metaphor, more than you're ready for
More intellectual
More than electrical, glowing like Eddison
I'm more than ahead of 'em
I'm over the head of them, more than a spectacle
I could do more than a weapon could
'Cause I'm loaded but deadly (EarDrummers)
I'm undeniable
I'm unbelievable
I'm undefeatable, I'm pretty powеrful
I'm so high, I'm unreachable
I'm not impeachablе, I promise
They'll never forget me like Obama
They'll never forget me like Alzheimer's
In memory lane, they all drivers
That nigga, Lil Wayne, an all timer
And I'd rather you forget me than remember me wrong
Who is Nat King Cole? Call me Nat King Kong (Hrrr)

Take off your coat, take off your cliché
Show off a side that no one sees
You got the whole world right here in your pocket
Chasing those stardust melodies
See Alicia Keys LiveGet tickets as low as $12You might also like
So if you wanna leave alone
You gotta put on your finest
If you wanna sing your song
You gotta put the time into timeless
If you wanna take it all, let the chandeliers fall (Fall)
While you standing tall like the Taj Mahal
Be unforgettable
Like Nat King Cole
Like Nat King Cole

There are no endings, there are no yesterdays
When you hit a chord that everyone hears
Emeralds and rubies, black and white movies
They never truly fade away
'Cause greatness never disappears

So if you wanna leave alone
You gotta put on your finest
If you wanna sing your song
You gotta put the time into timeless
If you wanna take it all, let the chandeliers fall (Fall)
While you standing tall like the Taj Mahal
Be unforgettable
Like Nat King Cole (We take the moment by storm)
Like Nat King Cole (Oh yeah)
Like Nat King Cole (We're unforgettable)
Like Nat King Cole (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
Show off, show off (Mm, mm, mm, mm)
Show off, show off (Mm, mm, mm, mm)
