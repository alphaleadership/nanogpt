3 ContributorsDrop It Low (G-Mix) LyricsWhe
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it—
Drop it, drop it

Three sprays of cologne, neck, chest, and wrist
None fresh as this, best check your chick, fella
Fella, best check your bitch, fella (Drop it low)
Fuck your bitch, fella
You don't wanna fuck with us, yeah
Homie, where your girl at? (Ayy)
This is the remix
Shawty, where your girls at? (Ayy)
Homie, where your girl at? (Ayy)
I know where your girl at (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Yeah, come on
I see you Polow
And I'ma never bring your girl back (Ayy)
They call me Diddy
Trey Songz, Chris (Let's go), Weezy (Ayy)
Never bring your girl back, never bring your girl

Em, if your ass too big, I make you back that ass up
I only go down if you keep your grass cut
Hair to the back, hat to the front
Weezy F. baby, tatted on the butt
Okay, still remixin' with one of these vixens
I make her ride me like I'm Sea Biscuit
Miss Ester Dean, you can get it
Look, I like a nice two-pack and a booty on biggie (Haha)
What's really good? What you know about it?
Swagger too good (Let's go), I should notarize it
Yeah, they call me Tune, no Bugs Bunny
Make the booty clap, give it up for me
Yeah, it's Young Money, you know I brung money
I make that booty talk, Connie Chung for me
I got her butt naked in a red Snuggie
I make her drop it low like she duckin' from me
Now where she at? (Ayy) Where she at?
Where she at? (Ayy) Where she at?
There she go (Ayy), there she go
There she go (Ayy), there she go
She bring it back (Ayy), bring it back
Br-Bring it back (Ayy), bring it back
Then she drop it low (Ayy), drop it low
Drop it low (Ayy, ayy), ya dig

E-E-East low ride, booty big, so the thong show
"How Low Can You Go?" Ludacris, oh, no
Limbo, Timbo's, V-neck, Polo
Make that booty jump, ju-ju-ju-jump for my pogo
Yeah, see the way I ball, no NBA logo
Motherfuckin' swag, got a whole lot of mojo
Five top tens, you can say I'm on a row, ho
Sign a couple autographs, take a couple photos
Long as a flute, baby, tell me can you blow though?
Went under the belt, then she hit me with the low blow
We losin' the clothes, but that's way after the show though
Sex so crazy, Spanish, loco
Now I head home like Daute' Toro
Track "So Gone," Zone folk, Polow (Yeah)
Ask her what it is, shawty drop it like some kids at her mama house
I'm about to give her the business
Got the dawgs with me, lookin' for a bone (Yeah, uh, stop)
Baby, you the only one I want (Let's rock, this is the remix)
Girl, you move that thing like you grown (Come on, come on, Polow)
I want a Nicki Minaj with your clothes (Hit 'em with it now)
Drop it, drop it low, girl (Yeah), drop it, drop it low, girl (Uh-huh, come on)
Drop it, drop it low, girl (Yeah), drop it, drop it low, girl (Uh. come on)
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl (I see y'all out there)
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl (I think you can get lower though)
Drop it, drop it (I think you can get lower though, ayy)
I'ma give a million dollars (Ayy) to the chick that can get the lowest (Ayy, ayy)
Low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl
Now drop it low for me (Ayy)
Drop it low for me (Ayy)
Drop it low for me (Ayy)
