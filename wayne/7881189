Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I'm so sorry, but I lied
You feel a little bit better when you close your eyes, cl-close your eyes
Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I know you hate this 'cause I'm right
Just close your eyes, this is my
M-m-m-my lullaby-by-by-by-by

Hush, hush
Hush, hush
Hush, hush
Hush, hush

Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I'm so sorry, but I lied
You feel a little bit better when you close your eyes, cl-close your eyes
Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I know you hate this 'cause I'm right
Just close your eyes, this is my
M-m-m-my lullaby-by-by-by-by

Hush, hush
Hush, hush
Hush, hush
Hush, hush
