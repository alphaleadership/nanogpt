20 ContributorsLast Night Lyrics
I can’t believe, what we did last night
I wanna wake up in the morning sun
Falling over, telling everyone, I can’t believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my God, that was so much fun
I'll never forget it, telling everyone about last night

Last night was awesome, super fucking awesome
It was me, myself and I and her, we had ourself a foursome
And I didn't want the night to end
Percocet meet Vicodin
Now I'm gone like the wind, If you're the bomb
I'd bite the pin ( boom!)
Whatever, I can love you better
Bust it wide open for a Trukfit sweater
And I can make you put a little duck, get wetter
And it's been world peace since I met her
Last night, I had fun with her
I got 99 problems, not one with her
And excuse my french, but fuck the cameras
I wanna spend a night in Paris

I can’t believe, what we did last night
I wanna wake up in the morning sun
Falling over, telling everyone, I can’t believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my God, that was so much fun
I'll never forget it, telling everyone about last nightYou might also like6Embed
