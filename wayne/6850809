I see her
She came with her nigga
Mm, but she gon' slide right to my side, I know
She pulled up with her friends
Then we skrrt off in the Benz, oh-oh, oh
Took her back to my crib and I regret it
'Cause she tryna (Ayy)

Fake like she asleep (Uh)
Swear she tried to stay the whole week
I'm like "Oh, nah, she gotta go", uh
Ask me her name, I swear I don't even fuckin' know
They wanna know why di gyal dem deh 'pon me
Dem eyе green, dem mind just set pon me
Thеy wanna know why dem love him off so much
Like what is the reason, oh-oh, oh

Mm, it's just the vibe, I'm that guy
She put her legs in the sky whenever I
Pull up, she got her clothes off from the walk-in
She won't waste no time, oh
She don't want nobody else, I know
But I can't be what she wants
They all have the same story
They all want me to themselves
You might also like
But I'm a gyalis
The city is my palace
What I'ma do?
'Cause I want she and she and she
And they love them some me
I ain't the nigga they gon' say bye to
I ain't the nigga you gotta lie to
I ain't the nigga that you could trust on speaker
When you wit' your people
'Cause you know the timing I'm on
I want she and she and she
And they love them some me
I can't even speak
To all of 'em, so I call her on the FaceTime
She gon' pick up on the first ring
Ooh, I got her wrapped around my damn finger
I will never tell a soul, oh no, no
Mm, girl, we grown
The life of a gyalis7Embed
