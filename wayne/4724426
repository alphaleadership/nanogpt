34 ContributorsLil Wayne Lyrics
Yeah
OZ on the beat, yeah

Shawty say she wanna roll with me
Get high with me, lil' baby, roll my weed
Got the chopper on me, bitch, in the backseat
Tryna sink my damn thoughts with these trees
Like a Bible open when I spread her legs like the seas
Just you and me, you and me, you and me, yeah
I'm in your seat, you and me, you and me, yeah
I'm in your seat, you and me, you and me, yeah (Yeah)

Keep my four right by my Bible in the glove compartment, yeah
Talking gangster shit, then be a thug about it
Put your heart up in the street, ain't get no love up out it, yeah
Pistol to the sky, don't give no fucks about it
Nigga, knuck about it, nigga, buck about it, yeah
Choppers out in public, we gon' bust about it
If I like it, yeah, it's a must I cop it
Foreign whip leave you in the dust about it

Shawty say she wanna roll with me
Get high with me, lil' baby, roll my weed
Got the chopper on me, bitch, in the backseat
Tryna sink my damn thoughts with these trees
Like a Bible open when I spread her legs like the seas
Just you and me, you and me, you and me, yeah
I'm in your seat, you and me, you and me, yeah
I'm in your seat, you and me, you and me, yeahSee Trippie Redd LiveGet tickets as low as $37You might also like5Embed
