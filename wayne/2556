24 ContributorsIâ€™m On It Lyrics
Haha, haha, I-I'm on it
I'm on it, uh, uh
I-I'm on it
Ha, ha, ha, I'm on it
I-If we talkin' 'bout money, bitch, I'm on it

Ha, snapback, chin up, gold chain nigga
Stripes no Tigger, Tyga bitches
Hundred proof liquor, live no liver
There's hoes in this muthafucka straight trippin'
A nigga no different, so we hold the heat though
Smash on the bitch, brains lookin' like meatloaf
The ho know me close, she lyin', Leos
Pedigree and swag is so cold, zero
Hop in Medino, oops, I meant Medina
Life is a bitch, better know how to treat her
I don't get in between, my goal be to win
Young Money Heisman, rookies of the year, bitch

Haha, haha, I-I'm on it
I'm on it, uh, uh
I-I'm on it
Ha, ha, ha, I'm on it
I-If we talkin' 'bout money, bitch, I'm on it
See Tyga LiveGet tickets as low as $44You might also like
Ha, raise hell boy, hell yeah, I'm hot, hello
Boy yellow but my bitch black from the ghetto
Put the flow in a pot, watch the shit sizzle
You grillin' me, better break fast, McGriddle
I ain't finna slow down, keep runnin' your mouth
I'm runnin' the real estate, party in the fuckin' house
My niggas is loud in the lobby, they can't shut us down
Ha-Have a drink, drink, drink, some Coke and a smile
No clown, but I hit the party then I'm out
I run town all day, twenty-four miles
A hunnid and fifty on the dash, can't even count
K-Keep fuckin', bitch, ain't shit to talk about

Haha, haha, I-I'm on it
I'm on it, uh, uh
I-I'm on it
Ha, ha, ha, I'm on it
I-If we talkin' 'bout money, bitch, I'm on it
Ah, ah, ah, oh

Uh, be-best rapper, C.E.O
Fine as wine flow, Pinot Grigio
Niggas can't fuck with me
Neither bitches, neither hoes
Life is a motherfuckin' gamble, Peter Rose
Momma taught me well, kush and the L
Paper everywhere like books just fell
More money to make, more pussy to smell
Like yeah, I'm a Libra, life or death on a scale
New Orleans nigga with my dick up in my right hand
Young Money nigga, money longer than a lifespan
Still go to sleep with my Bible on my nightstand
Flyer than a bitch and you ain't even got your flight plan
Haha, haha, I-I'm on it (Haha)
I'm on it, uh, uh
I-I'm on it
Ha, ha, ha (Tunechi), I'm on it (Yeah)
I-If we talkin' 'bout money, bitch, I'm on it (Tunechi)

So woo
Soo woo, trill (I'm on it)
Hahahaha (I-I'm on it)
Yeah (I-I'm on it)
I-If we talkin' 'bout money, bitch, I'm on it2Embed
