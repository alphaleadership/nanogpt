Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Sucker free, fuck a freak, everybody look at me
Codeine in my cup of tea
Suck a D and brush your teeth
Y'all give me the fuckin' creeps
Y'all give me the fuckin' creeps
My life is a fuckin' beach
White girl tannin' turn to peach
My life is a fuckin' beach
Money talkin', comma, speech
Throwin' sign like Robin Leach
Rest in peace to Robin Leach
She say "Hi", I say "Yeeerrrp!"
She was high, I was geeked
She sniff white, I pop Percs
I pop white and I pop pink
I want silence from the lions
Whole jungle know my name
I want the answer to the million dollar question
Nigga come and count my change

Uh, thug life forever
Thug life for
You might also like
I want my baby pictures on a hundred dollar bill (Yeah, yeah)
My lazy bitches teach my crazy bitches how to chill (Yeah, yeah)
Can't keep my love life and drug life opposite (Yeah, yeah)
I just popped my second rubber then I popped a pill (Yeah, yeah)
Huhhh (Yeah)
Then I scream, "Thug life forever"
Gun fights wherever
It's a cold world, hope the sun shine forever
We got one life, whatever
Bitches fuck like we devils
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen
Put the one beside the seven
Bitch, it's thug life forever
Gun fights wherever
Nina by my side, I treat her like she special, man
It's a cold world, hope the sun shine forever
We got one life, whatever
Bitches fuck like we devils, yeah

Yes, we live that mothafuckin' thug life
She gon' suck this dick 'til she get tongue-tied
Hop out on your set, throw up the Blood sign
Ratta-tatta, tatta-tatta, doves fly
It's ratta-tat-tat-tatter scatter or get splattered
Data it don't matter, get your shadow shattered
'Specially if you rata taddle
Get that ratta-tat to your tail
Or put the ratta-tatter in your madulla
Oblongata it'll rattle, earthquake to Saturn
Stop all the chatter, slap up your madem
Hop back in the Phantom, screamin' out the anthem
Thug life (Thug life), thug life (Thug life)
What life? Thug life (Thug life)
Love life (Love life)
What life? (What life?)
Fuck life, fuck life
Thug life (Thug life), thug life (Thug life)
What life? Thug life (Thug life)
Love life (Love life)
What life? (What life?)
Fuck life, fuck life

Look, yeah
Don't ask no questions, I'm the only answer (Don't)
Shit, swing through your section, I'm the homie status (Bah, bah)
Make you perform in front the gun like you some sort of dancer (Yeah)
Your best resort is you should run like you some sort of prince
Damn, killa boss, kill the hoes (Yeah)
Many games, take a loss (Yeah)
Pure lost, man exhaust (Yeah)
My pill bustin' a car for real
Thugs doubt, it's so hard to feel
I done came from the Grove (Yeah)
I used to hang 'round the fiends (For real)
Now I hang with the G.O.A.T
Dead, I was broke, layin' on the floor
Fuck that, I ain't never goin' back
Float me a boat, move me a ho
Pimpin', ain't never goin' back
Mask up, pick the  up
It's a cash rush, I got somethin' for his ass
Stand up, nigga man up
Pick your pants up, come and bring it to the stash
We cashed out
Yeah, we live that mothafuckin' thug life
And she gon' suck this dick 'til she get tongue-tied
And I got them goons on the front line
Ratta-tatta, tatta-tatta, doves fly
Thug life forever (Yeah)
Gun fights wherever (Yeah)
It's a cold world, hope the sun shine forever
We got one life, whatever
Screamin', "Fuck life", we devils
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen
Put the one beside the seven
Bitch, it's thug life forever
Seventeen
Put the one beside the seven, yeah

Thug life, thug life
What life? Thug life
Love life (Love life)
What life? (What life?)
Fuck life, fuck life

Thug life (Thug life), thug life (Thug life)
Middle fingers up, livin' thug life, ayy
Traphouse jumpin', got a lunch line, ayy
Big Body Benz, nigga plus size, yeah
Bad bitch let me fuck one time (Yeah)
Bad bitch, I only fuck sometimes (Woo, yeah)
I'm grindin' baby girl to see the upside (No)
Tell my girl I'm on strike like an umpire (Woo)
My whippin' is crazy, whippin' this foreign
And the baby stands on the stove, I'm slavin'
Cook up the coke then shavin'
Mula the Army, the Navy
Fuck all you niggas, to each is own
I fuck on that bitch that you bleedin' on
I'm cuppin' on niggas, Codeine, cologne
Fuck y'all I'm sippin' Céline Dion
King of the kitchen, yeah, my seat is a throne (Yeah)
Phone keep ringin', bih leave me alone (Brrr)
Banana clip hangin' at Chiquita Capone
And she clappin' at your ass, like I'm singin' the song
Screamin' thug life (Thug life), thug life (Thug life)
Bag full plus the shoebox
Backwoods stuffed with moonrocks
Send a hunnid shots then we wuzzop

Thug life forever, thug life forever
Screamin' "Thug life to Heaven"
All the thugs cry together
We got, one life, fuck life
We may all die together
Bitch it's thug life forever, bitch it's thug life, thug life
Yes, we live that mothafuckin' thug life
Fuckin' on your bitch 'til she a doves cry
Sippin' on that motherfuckin' mudslide
Mula Gang, Mula Gang, Mula GangEmbed
