56 ContributorsOxy Lyrics
I see funny faces
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
This for the world
Oxy-Oxy, yeah, Freebandz
I just told Richie we rich

Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Look at my wrist, Oxy
Look at my bitch, Oxy
Oxy, Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Look at my bitch, Oxy
Look at my clique
Oxy

Medicine Man
Medicine Man, taking off never to land
United we fall, together we stand
I pop a whole, she took a half
I'm feelin’ gold, she lookin' tan
It never gets old, she never get mad
"We too high to fuck," I never hear that
Cotton candy, sweet as gold
Make that pussy open, close
She take her meds up her nose
Lookin' like she smelled a rose
It says Hermès on my clothes
20 mg, that’s my dose
I fucked her off one of those
She act like she saw a ghost
Wake up baby, comatose
Wake up baby, vamonos
Sleeping like we on an island somewhere in Galapagos
It's lonely at the top, we hold hands and Geronimo
100 percent cotton, oxymoron, Oxycontin

Look at my bitch, Oxy
Look at my clique, Oxy

Matchy-matchy, nigga, just stop it
Niggas always try to copy
Drinkin' saké, Hachi Tachi
I eat beef, Johnny Rocket
Over the bowl, in the faucet
Crank that ho, John Gotti
Ben Frank, meet the pocket
Pocket watchin', pick a pocket
Richard Mille prolly
Got me lookin' cocky
Drinkin' in the lobby
Catch it, Jeremy Shockey
Cuban link my wallet, and it's camouflagin'
It ain’t no discussion
Better hit your target
Bentley with the roof
Got Versace carpet
Sippin’ lean like soup
Yeah, Hachi Tachi
I'ma pop an X
I’ma try the Oxy
I just tried ooh
I can't feel my body
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
