5 ContributorsNever Let It Lyrics& In the back of my mind I’m hoping that she...
In the back of my mind...

She say, I don’t want this night to end
Why does it feel like the end?
Why does it feel like pretend?
Why does it feel like we friends?
I don’t say shit, I just grin
& I don’t know why..
I just be me, I’m just him
& she just want me & not them
& I just wanna leave how I came
The weather man said it’s gon rain
& I don’t wanna drive in the rain
I be speedin’ & shit!
& you think I’m late to a bitch
You see, that’s that shit that make
Me wanna break up and shit
Make you wanna break up some shit
Don’t break up my tints
I break up some kush
You wake up yo friends
Just to hear them say not again
I just stay out of it
Girl one day ima get tired of this
& If they are not telling you that
Baby they not yo friends
Fuck dem other niggas
She be like, Fuck dem other hoes
I be like, Fuck dem other hoes
I ain’t wife’n up dem other hoes
I ain’t wife’n nothing til I’m old
Stuntin on dem hoes
& you just want me for yo fuckin self
To hold me hostage; In you’re underwear
When you know I got shit to do somewhere else
Then she take it out her pussy
& put it somewhere else! (Lord)
You might also like
& in the back of my mind
I’m hoping that she swallow.. (She swallow)
& in the back of my mind
I’m hoping that she can wobble.. (She can wobble)
Cause if she know like I know... (Like I know)
She better shake that ass, (Shake that ass)
If she tryna make it last!

I don’t want this high to end
Why do you feel like my end?
Why didn’t I strengthen my chin?
Love TKO, count to ten
& I don’t say shit, I just win
& I don’t know why..
I just be me, I’m just him
& I just wanna be who I been
I just wanna leave how I came
I just wanna beat more then traffic
I take the streets not the bridge
I got meetings & shit
& she think I’m cheating & shit
You see that’s the shit I be, wait!?
Whatchu mean this yo dick?!
I can’t even answer my phone
You be screening my shit
I be like, girl it’s me & you’re bitch
But, you just want me for yo fuckin self
You say when I leave you gon fuck yoself
Then text me “hello” with a bunch of L’s!
Fuck them other bitches
I be like, Huh? What other bitches?
I be playing dumb with all the bitches
But I be rambunctious with the business
Gotta have toughness & resilience
When you fuckin with dem millions
& I’m fuckin with dem millions
I take ya home, & fuck ya on a million
Then I’m fuckin off a million
I spend it on gas, I’m pumpin lil nigga
Catch me pullin out the shell
Like a stomping armadillo
I’m fuckin on my off day, only on my off day
Pussy gotta soft space, I treat it
Like a crawl space
I done had a long day, I deserve a long break
I been workin hard bae, do me like the lord say
& I know if I don’t stay, I get ya puppy dog face
Now, who the hell can resist ya puppy dog face?
I sit my keys back down & abut face
& bust through the bedroom doors like
Scarface say, “Hello.”

& in the back of my mind
I’m hoping that she swallow..
& in the back of my mind
I’m hoping that she can wobble..
Cause if she know like I know...
She better shake that ass
If she tryna make it last!
She tryna make it last
She fine as Stacey Dash
She bout to make me crash
Cause she got me racing back
She got me breaking bad
She got amazing ass
& she bout to shake that ass
If she tryna make it last
Ohhh! You just want me for yo fuckin self
To hold me hostage; In you’re underwear
When you know I got shit to do somewhere else
Then she take it out her pussy
& put it somewhere else!
Girl you just want me for yo fuckin self
You know I got shit to do somewhere else
You say when I leave you gon fuck yoself
Then text me “hello” with a bunch of L’s!
(Lord)
I don’t want this night to end
Why does it feel like the end?
Why does it feel like pretend?
Why does it feel like we friends?
I don’t say shit. I just grin
& I don’t know why..
I just be me. I’m just him
& I just wanna be who I been
I just wanna leave how I came
I just wanna beat more then traffic
& it was fantastic. & she said:
“I don’t like this type of gin.”
“Only prefer ice & henn.”
“Only see you on weekends
Why you treat me like we kin?”
& I don’t say shit, I just pimp
& I don’t know why..
I just be me, I’m just him
& she just want me & not them
& I just wanna leave how I came
I just wanna beat more then traffic
But it was so good while it lasted

& in the back of my mind
I’m hoping that she....
In the back of my mind
I’m hoping that she can wobble....
Cause if she know like I know;
She betta shake that ass
If she tryna make it last. (Ohhhh!)7Embed
