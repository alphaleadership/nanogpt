8 ContributorsThe Profit Lyrics
We gettin' money man I'll show you how to turn profit
In the hood, they call me Joey the prophet
First, you cop it, then you cook it, then you chop it
The fuck boy bitch ass niggas, they can't stop us
We turn a profit, p-p-p-p-profit p-profit
We making profit, p-p-p-p-profit p-profit
Yeah in the hood they call me Joey the prophet
If you listen close my niggas, you bound to see a profit

I'm New York's living legend
The streets know me well
Stand in the line of fire
It's going to be hell
You dancin' wit' the Devil
Tonight's your last night
Picture me Lil Eazy E, pistol Fahrenheit
LA County got work in Slawson
We get it poppin'
Back to Roxbury in Boston
The streets love me
See they named me coca
We the Puerto Rican version of La Costra Nostra
You can find me in the kitchen with my apron on
Something like a chef, yeah I get my Raekwon on
Joey the Mayor, I get Keys to the city
And I got 'em cheap the whole hood could come with me

Cook 'em up, strap 'em down where the road at?
I'm strapped up plenty bullets, nigga hold that
Now you steppin' out a lead shower, where your robe at?
I knock your earth off, damn where ya globe at?
Fuck the coach I keep shooting like Kobe
The money knows me better than anybody
Bitch I'm paid forget about it
I'm sitting in the coupe wit the titties outted
The nipples chrome
Or that big black thing wit the slippers on that bullshit
Dippin' on them bitches, get off dick
You soft pricks

Homeless but don't forget
The sun even shines on dog shit
And dawg I've been hustlin' since the day I was barkin'
I walk in this bitch like what it do
The money home, stop hatin'

This year all-star weekend was off the chain
Literally niggas comin' off wit them chains
Put the Desi to his chest
Homey gon' die tonight
Then his jaw dropped like Napoleon dynamite
Jack boy I been since I'm a toddler
My dad was sleeping I was running through his pockets
Oh yeah you ready for war then what's stopping you
I hope you know them Bentley doors not chopper proof
And they go Br R-RR Ta Tat just like them bullets dancin'
Come up short wit my doe I'm bout to pull a Manson
Take your kids for ransom, yeah, it's payback
Next time I front you some birds you better pay crack
What, shit, I don't know nothing
He might be the police coming up with assumptions
All I know is this nigga here is about to meet God
If he don't bring me some keys or pay me fifty large
We gettin' money man I'll show you how to turn profit
In the hood, they call me Joey the prophet
First, you cop it, then you cook it, then you chop it
The fuck boy bitch ass niggas, they can't stop us
