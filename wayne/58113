20 ContributorsSunshine Lyrics
Ayy (What), yo (Y'all)
Young Money, nigga
Hello Brooklyn (Jigga)
President Carter, Nicki Lewinsky

Me and the Dread, yo, give him some head, blow
Long as he know he keep me flyer than a Red Bull
Don't give a damn when Christmas is
My bitches is president mistresses
Now let's go, I'm wit' the boss (Kyuh), I'm Ms. Ross (Okay)
I make them girls jump like I'm Kris Kross
Back to basics, bitch, I been hot since Asics
And I'm tighter than face lifts, flyer than spaceships
Now as for Dread? I met him on Mars (Okay)
I said, "I am Minaj and I'm gooder with the bars"
He said that he a Martian, he can be my Tarzan
And he lookin' for a bad bitch for his squadron
That's how we got together, see he control the weather
I leave my planet never without my um-ba-reller
It's Dirty Money, slash, Young Money, Cash Money
You can't catch money, run it, nigga, fast money
Gettin' at Weezy, you comin' through me-ezy
And I won't hesitate to do anyone greasy
If he give me the word then I'm flippin' the bird
And then I'm spinnin' around and I'm grippin' the burner
See, I been the bitch since bubble gum and double dutch
You was playin' hopscotch, bitch, I been top notch
Bitches is wack, they trash, they just pollution
Write ya own raps, make that your resolution, fucka
You might also like
Touch me with a heart of gold (Uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine (Uh-huh, say what? Uh)
Touch me with a smile of gold
I can't go a day (Yeah) without my sunshine, sunshine (I got you baby, uh, uh, uh)

Yeah, okay, I'm Dread, yo, I keep a red ho
I keep a red bow, Blood gang, bitch
I get that bread dough, I get that head blow
Until she got a red throat (Haha)
Now who be rollin' with the boy like sushi?
She said her name was Nicki, I'm Tunechi
I ain't have to introduce me, she knew me
I told her that's she's unique like a boutique
And I got her and she said she got me
Now let's go, she with the boss and I'm the boss
"He the President, yeah, she Lewinsky" but we never get caught
And I could give her brain back because I'm so smart
Fuck with my bitch and I'ma draw like Picasso art
Yeah, I spit at you like a hot beat
And nigga if it's not her then it's (Not me)
Yeah, as for her I met her on Mars and she said
"I am Minaj, and I'm gooder with the bars"
She got me with her charm, my wings on my arms
Now we flyin' over chicken heads, shittin' on ya farm
Like sittin' on a thorn, like sittin' on a horn
We stickin' to your ass, like brass
So get a new alarm for me and Miss Nicki Barnes
'Cause we kill everyone and get acquitted in the morn'
So get a new alarm for me and Miss Nicki Barnes
'Cause we kill everyone and get acquitted in the morning, bling
Touch me with a heart of gold (Uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine (Hello Brooklyn, Big Boogie, I told you we would go through it, baby)
Touch me with a smile of gold (Okay, Nicki Minaj, uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine (Nicki Lewinsky, Weezy F, the martian), sunshine (Listen, goin' back to my planet, holler)

Listen, uh-huh, Mr. President, you know the mistress gotta holler at you for a minute, right?
Like I mean, you know, meet the girl in the Oval Office it's nothin'
It's goin' down
Tell your wife you gon' be a lil' late tonight, hahaha, kyuh5Embed
