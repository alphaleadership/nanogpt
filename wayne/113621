Early in the morning's when I think about you, yeah
I hit you like "What you sayin'?"
In the morning's when I wanna fuck you, yeah
I hit you like "What you sayin'?"
I-I-I could fuck you all the time
I-I-I could fuck you all the time

M-O-Ë-T, that's the fuck we sippin' (Sippin')
That's the fuck we drippin' (Drippin')
Trap house still tippin'
FaceTime when I'm gone
She give me dome from a distance
And she love to climb on top
She love to walk off limpin'
Pimps up, hoes down
Legs up or toes down
Why she jock me? 'Cause she knocked knees
And we got trees, so Mary, go 'round
Gotta know I ate it
She so sweet, now and later
I want that all the time, all the time
I mean you all of mines when it's—

Early in the morning's when I think about you, yeah
I hit you like "What you sayin'?"
In the morning's when I wanna fuck you, yeah
I hit you like "What you sayin'?"
I-I-I could fuck you all the time (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I-I-I could fuck you all the time (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Uh, pu-pu-pu-pussy for breakfast, that's how I start my day
My dick is a pen, it's written all over her face
I put my tongue in her mouth
I make them pussy lips drool
She got that junk in her trunk
You know I like junk food
I tell her like this, life is good (Good)
Your pussy better (Better)
I put on a magnum (Magnum)
Like a gold medal (Medal)
And if it's sweet then I'ma eat it 'til I get sugar diabetes
I'm a blood and she anemic, we perfect

Got a nigga out here feelin' picky-icky-icky
Every time you put it on me, man, it leave me real trippy
Every time we on it we keep it 50-50, uh
Don't let the time picky-icky-icky
While I'm snappin' off your bra and bitin' on your Vickie's

Gettin' real freaky and it's gettin' real frisky
She never say, "No"
Damn, she's so cold
Up and down that pole
She go, go (Go, go, damn)

Kiss me like you miss me (Yeah)
Anything I want to (Yeah)
