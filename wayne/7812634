Bongo by the way

Pray for my enemies, Lord, I need clarity (Yeah)
They ain't got empathy for me, they stare at me (What?)
They used my couch when they needed the therapy (Shh)
Took what they needed but never took care of me (Yeah)
They saw a dollar sign, treat me like currency (Brr)
Kill all they hopes and dreams if they want murder me (Yeah, yeah)
Sunshine on me (Uh)

Sunshine on me, I just lеt the sunshine on me (Yеah, yeah)
Sunshine on me, I just let the sunshine on me
Sunshine on me, I just let the sunshine on me, yeah, yeah (Oh)

Yeah, pray if they run up, I'ma cut up
Bring out these VV's (Ayy) like the sun up (Yeah)
These niggas Stevie (What?) to the come up
Went got my bread up, let 'em wonder
If I ain't do nothing, I kept it one hundred (Ayy)
Big Latto for real, I ain't never done fronted
They do what they can, bitch, I do what I wanna (Bitch)

Pray for my enemies, Lord, I need clarity
They ain't got empathy for me, they stare at me
They used my couch when they needed the therapy
Took what they needed but never took care of me
They saw a dollar sign, treat me like currency
Kill all they hopes and dreams if they want murder me
Sunshine on me

I love when it's sunny, that boy ain't no dummy
I slide off a gummy, I heard I got money
But still dressing bummy, I'm sweeter than honey
I'm sweeter at rapping like what the fuck happened?
Came back and he's snapping, came back with a passion
These niggas was cappin', they talkin' on me, hmm
I bought a .9 when that COVID hit
She said my Gucci don't go with it
Just tryna be happy, "get money" the motto
My girl hit the lotto, my sons are mulatto
My sons are all healthy, ain't shit you can tell me
I'm hotter than Nelly, they say that I'm smelly
Ain't never smelled wealthy, I think
Yeah, I got mass drip like a sink
Skated, you not in the rink
Pray for my enemies, Lord, I need clarity
They ain't got empathy for me, they stare at me
They used my couch when they needed the therapy
Took what they needed but never took care of me
They saw a dollar sign, treat me like currency
Kill all they hopes and dreams if they want murder me
Sunshine on me

Sunshine on me, I just let the sunshine on me (Shine, shine, shine)
Sunshine on me, I just let the sunshine on me (I get my shine on, I get my shine on)
Sunshine on me, I just let the sun shine on me, yeah, yeah (I get my shine on, I get my shine on, bitch, I'm the golden child)
