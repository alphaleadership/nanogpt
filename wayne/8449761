1 ContributorSTAYTRUTRIPPYIAINT LyricsOut of her skirt
Dancing on mirrors
Into her nostrils
She plottin’ on fossil because of the way i’m spreading my gospel
Hella apostles, bitch, who trying to stop me
Judas witha Ruger
Can't even come pop me
I hope that they don't
Try to 2Pac me
The only one scared about
Being too poppin
But no other option, being broke not an option
I'd rather get rope
And then
Climb to the top
Then jump the fuck off and then kill myself
You know what the fuck I'm saying
Fuck that shit
Get this dough
Fuck that bitch
Wrist done froze
Broke my wrist
Tryna fist fuck a bitch
I need flight, fee
Hotel now
Don't like mе
Oh well now
You should have held mе down
Now I'm just
Gonna watch you drown
I’m back on clear boy fuck the brown
Yeah, i feel fantastic
You might also likeShorty say she so elastic
Nasty, ass thick
Doll face, plastic
She can't fathom
How i
Split her atoms
Leave her soaking wet, jerkin', hurtin'
Having spasms
A cata-clysm
When a real-one hit
Cryptic
My tounge you can’t decipher shit
I'm whippin', I'm whippin'
KNA-MOAN-YAHhhh
Pneumonia
My wrist
Walk right in your shit, give no fuck about
Your list
'Cause I need a check
Young hot ebony
And pale brunette
You can miss me with that shit
Bout who next
While I flex
Flex, flex
Flex, flex, flex
Why can't I
Cry money
Instead of tears?
Ride around in brand new gear
Hella ammo, no more fear
Why can't I cry money instead of tears?
So much white, so much clear
I could never have career
Why can't I
Cry money
Instead of tears?
Alizay, black gold
Pussy lips, black hole
Young gogetta, white goals
Serving them packs
(Servin' the, gang)
Collecting them racks
(Cash, cash, cash, cash)
Collecting them bags
(Cash, cash, cash, cash)
Shooting shit like the Regal
Shooting shit like the Regal

If drew didn’t film it
It ain’t filmed right

Got a
Nice beach home
Still counting

Southside in my blood (Blood)
Flatbed from the mud (it’s got mud)
Pulled up in a truck
Inter-racial in my cup
