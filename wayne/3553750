I went from nothing to everything
I went from finer to better things
Colombiana and Mary Jane
Stuffed the Eddie Bauer with Eddie Cane
Straight to the top, fuck the middle man
I cut him out, Edward Scissorhands
Every time I pop thousand milligrams
Spin 'til I drop like the ceiling fans
Bad bitch pretty, she pretty bad
She might get a bag that come with a bag
Pull out a molly bag, let her dib and dab
Let the money talk 'til it jibber jab
My plug just hit me with the give and go
Now I'm over the stove and I'm whipping Nash
Tell the boogeyman "I'm the bigger man,"
Tell the trigger man, "pull the trigger, man"
Pull up on yo ass, two seater
Pull off fast like a loose cheetah
One diamond ring on two fingers
Cheating on these hoes, call me Tune Cheadle
Look how they grinnin' and blushin'
I got the enemy rushin'
Get it? The enemy Russian
Fuck it, end of discussion
Tune'
Money team

Ain't talkin', no money, it's nothing (It's nothing)

Want a bag, left the bitch at the door (Bitch)
Pinky on froze (Froze)
Made a milli', you was chasin' them hoes (Milli')
The money don't fold (Fold)
Baby mama keep calling my phone (Whoa)
She ride it like a Harley, bitches call me gnarly (Gnarly)
Them diamonds fufu, you ain't tricking nobody (What)
I came up from nothing (Nothing)
They was hating, I was getting to the money (Money)
My wrist on Dasani (Word)
Pussy good and she look like Kehlani (Yuh)
Stars in the Wraith (Wraith), automatic face (Neck)
She wanna fuck my chain (My chain)
Pussy poppin', but you bought her a Range (Whoa)
Just to come pull up on me (Me)
You probably flex for a week (Flex)
In Paris, a 50 at least (50)
Too many racks up on me (Rich)
