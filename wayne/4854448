7 ContributorsOld Town Road (Remix) Lyrics
I got the horses in the back but she twerk it for a pony
Ooh, she got that honky-tonky, I met her on Farmers Only
Red bandana around my neck, ooh my cowgirl getting dirty
I pop a couple perkies, I chew 'em like beef jerky
I pull up on a tractor, lean and Jolly Ranchers
Papa was a rolling stone, but me I'm more like Jagger
Aw man, quit jumblin' grown man
She ride me say, "Yeehaw", man
Call me Lil Jon Wayne
