3 ContributorsSunshine Lyrics
Whoa-ohh-oh-ohh.. come down now rude bwoy
Little Weezy Wez, try and take over as the rude bwoy now

I got a gold two thousand Jag, customized Cadillac
I got some shit with 17's on the front, and 20's on the back
My mom in a mansion, and my dad in a truck
Player my sister in a 2001 tinted and rimmed up
I take care of my baby mommas like we still together
When my brother get out of jail man I'ma buy him whatever
Credit in my yellow gold in exchange for white
Y'all saw me at the Source Awards, wasn't that shit like tight?
Cartier frames with wood grain on the ear
V.S.O.P. Hennessy, so save y'all fuckin' beers
A diehard nigga, a 3rd Ward nigga
7th Ward hardhead ready for war nigga
A Cash Money clown, tattooed and scarred nigga
I ain't bitchin' up for nar' one of y'all funky ass niggas
Princess cuts, baguettes and marquises, what that say?
Bad motherfuckin' baguettes in Chinese

Sunshine, in the middle of the night
Sunshine, with baguettes so bright
Sunshine, every place that I be
Sunshine, all of ya bwoys know me
Sunshine, in the middle of the night
Sunshine, with baguettes so bright
Sunshine, every place that I be
Sunshine, all of ya bwoys know me
See Juvenile LiveGet tickets as low as $81You might also like
We be holdin' the Cristal high so you can see
The princess cutted Presidential Rollie
Sho' Lil, won'tcha scratch the Rover, with the block TV (You lyin')
Six in the headrest, all got new TV's
Well look the other hand, holdin' a blunt real high
So you can see the Wonder Woman bracelet sunshine
2000, Navigation on nineteen inches
My mom in the six I ain't out ya penny pincher
God Bless Wayne, when I set foot on the scene
I make you take a triple take, at the bling, the bling-bling (What?)
Iced out sparklin' millionaire on the floor
Hittin these hoes with shit they never seen before
Now when you see my neck, you could just say, "Ooh"
That Hot Boy from Cash Money's a fool
In our platinum Benzes with the cat eyes
Flat screens in my crib with the flat I's

Sunshine, in the middle of the night
Sunshine, with baguettes so bright
Sunshine, every place that I be
Sunshine, all of ya bwoys know me
Sunshine, in the middle of the night
Sunshine, with baguettes so bright
Sunshine, every place that I be
Sunshine, all of ya bwoys know me
Hold up, there go Wayne, everybody be quiet
Oh my God! He's drivin' from the passenger's side
Million dollar conversation when I talk I'm shinin'
Nigga I, puh-puh, spit out diamonds
I change the grill on my truck so I don't blend with niggas
A young cat like me with Bill Clinton figures
I'ma expensive nigga, drive Bentleys nigga
 got it dropped on twenty inches nigga
Best type got navigation system nigga
VCR, PlayStation, televisions nigga
You know stuntin' is a habit, chrome on the Navi
TV's in that rear headrest to entertain the traffic
They call me the hot man, got the block on lock man
All my cars chopped man, all my trucks drop man
Trunk full of knock man, wrist full of rocks man
Pants full of Glocks man, sunshine spot man

Sunshine, in the middle of the night
Sunshine, with baguettes so bright
Sunshine, every place that I be
Sunshine, all of ya bwoys know me
Sunshine, in the middle of the night
Sunshine, with baguettes so bright
Sunshine, every place that I be
Sunshine, all of ya bwoys know me
Now you can catch me sunshinin' on the lake on Sunday, what's happenin' Fresh?
Don't fight, Sunny Delight, it's beautiful
Where, nigga, where you, where you be sunshinin' at?
Yeah I be sunshinin' up in my new Cadillac truck, or my new 2000 Jaguar, ya know me
My Lil nigga Weezy went and got Baby on his right arm
And Suga Slim on his left arm, whatchu think about that Geezy?
(That's wonderful) Hahaha (That's lovely) that's true
What, we gon' let, lovely take it out with his
R&B album bout to come out, he don't give a fuck about a bitch..
Sunshine is a sport man
Lil Turk sittin there spook as a motherfuckerEmbed
