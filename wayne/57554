28 ContributorsInkredible Lyrics
I-I-I-I-Incredible (Incredible, incredible, incredible)

Tha Truth back, let's get to business
It's something unfamiliar, call it a foreign image
Paint heavily leaking, I guess it wasn't finished
Riding with something freaky, they tell me she the business
The chain clear, stones never cloudy
Sixty racks or better, nigga ask about me
Certified gangsta, bitch don't ever doubt me
Welcome to the streets, you can't get in without me
I'm presidential, Obama painted the fo's black
Chopper in the Chevy, top rolled back
My life a motion picture, bitch I ain't gotta act
I send 'em to your section, nigga hold that
It's raining scattered bullets, too late to run for cover
I drain 'em like Kobe then I evacuate to the gutta
On somethin' that's pokey with looks and a trunk that like to stutter
I rank as the king of the city, it ain't gon be another

Incredible (Incredible, incredible, incredible)

Uh, I'm sending shots, it's happy hour
I shoot from close range, I'ma need a shower
Brains in the sink, body on the counter
Women and the kids, leave em how I found em
I'm a real nigga, stand still nigga
I'll cut your face, have you lookin like Seal nigga
Then I pull your card, then I deal with you
Gamble with your life, is this your lucky night?
My bitch so fucking right, every night I fuck her twice
Big boy money bitch, pockets on Charlie Wise
Tatted up, I'm scarred for life, tell the cops I know all my rights
Got choppers, I don't mean Harley bikes, drop 'em like a bag of ice
Shades dark, flag bright, wallet chain, chrome horse
Hair to the fucking back, call that shit Rosa Parks
Dr. Carter, man I gave hip-hop open heart
Young Money baby a.k.a Noah's Ark
You might also like
Incredible (Incredible, incredible, incredible)
Hahaha, and I'm Noah, hahaha
Young Mula baby!

My money long, my temper short
My cars foreign, my dick a boss
The guns new, the beef old
It's time to come through, like never before
Liquid C4, look at me ho
Look into my eyes, do you see a C.O.?
I'm talking kilo's, time to reload
Map fout ou deyo â€“ "Shut the fuck up" in Creole
Bitch I'm paid up, get ya weight up
Peel the top back, reel the shades up
I got them automatics so you know I'm automatic
All my auto's automatic, you know that's automatic
What you niggas want to see? Don't get caught in the street
I got G's that'll wait for a quarter key (Nigga)
I'm living nigga (Nigga) fuck the critics nigga (Fuck em)
Shit is serious nigga (Serious) you hear the lyrics nigga (Ricky)
