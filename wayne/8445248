1 ContributorPlease Don’t Go, Go (Extended US Mix) Lyrics
Oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Please don’t go, go, go, go
Please don't go, go, go, go
Oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Please don’t go, go, go, go
Please don't go, go, go, go
Please don't go, go, go, go
Oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, go

Don't let me go
Oh, no, no, oh, please don't let us go
I wanna know
Why do you wanna go?
Oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, go, go

Give me a hundred bricks and I'm outta here
Word to Holly Grove, I’ma get ’em outta here
Syrup and hydro, can't get a pop
We smell like footas, stick like snot
Yeah, fuck them, I’m hot
What, where, and whеn? Nigga, I been that nigga
Yeah, that's right, but you cook great, like Mom
Fuck up thе work and get that hook, left, right, Mom
Come on, push that button, nigga
Bring it 'round here, we'll go at it tonight, nigga
Checkin’, this icy niggas, it's shiesty niggas
That got buns and the cops on 'em, other stocks on 'em
I'm out wylin', baby, pray for 'em
Don't cry for 'em, wait for 'em, keep the lights on
Have a close-off, bitch, it's been a long day
Tomorrow mornin', back at it, bitch, first day, yeah

Don't let me go
Oh, no, no, oh, please don't let us go
I wanna know
Why do you wanna go?
Oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, go, go

Oh (Yeah, yeah, that's right)
Don't let it go, go (Listen to the sounds of the sirens)
Please don't go, go, go, go
Please don't go
No, baby, please don't go, go, go, go, go

Original, a lot of style, boom-pow
Blowin' on the pound, wha-pa-pa-pa-pow
Way up in the cloud, misbehave your flave'
Now let me show you how to maintain (Go)
It's a stain as I crush game
Smooth as silk, with a little bit of kush, mane
Plushtane, lavish livin'
Bust on the pigs with bad intentions
Smoke dope, bro for bro, Diango
The homie said, "9-1-1 is a joke"
And I believe that, so I protect this Earth
Every nigga on the block has my word
Cadillac drivin', stack at the Bible
Listen to the sounds of the sirens, I'm an OG nigga on a mission
Fiends gon' burn in the kitchen, I'm twistin' while dippin'
And crippin' (Crippin')
Don't let me go (And let me show you how)
Oh, no, no, oh, please don't let us go
I wanna know
Why do you wanna go?
Oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, go, go

Oh (Yeah, yeah, that's right)
Don't let it go, go (Listen to the sounds of the sirens)
Please don't go, go, go, go
Please don't go
No, baby, please don't go, go, go, go, go

Go, go, go, go
Please don't go, go, go, go
Please don't go, go, go, go
Please don't go, go, go, go
Oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, goEmbed
