28 ContributorsWasted (Album Remix) Lyrics
Burr
It's Young Burr
The State vs. Radric Davis
It's still Gucci
And we wasted

Rockstar lifestyle might don't make it (What's up, man? Wasted)
Livin' life high everyday, clique wasted (Birdman in here with me, my boy Weezy, wasted)
Sippin' on purple stuff, rollin' up stanky (Jadakiss, Gucci, wasted)
Wake up in the morning 10 o'clock drankin' (1017, Brick Squad, wasted)
Party, party, party, let's all get wasted (Wasted)
Shake it for me baby girl do it butt naked (Wasted)
I'm so wasted, she so wasted (Wasted, burr)
Tell the bartender send me twenty more cases (Burr, Gucci)

My alias is Gucci Mane, my name is Radric Davis (Who?)
If you take the time to step in front my shine, that time is wasted (Wow)
See I don't got time to waste, yes, I waste it with the crew
Yo girl drunk, she dropped it low and waste Dusse all over my True's (Well damn)
Back to the bass (Back to, back to, back to)
Man, I'm racist (Go), no, I'm not my Range Caucasian
Plus my goons smoke like Jamaicans (Burr)
You hibernatin' on me, you sleepy
Gucci ain't hot? Homeboy, you trippin'
Still concealin' coke in my console so yo kinfolks gon' keep drippin'
I'm movin' that 'caine like I'm moving my Range
Don't soil my name, just step up yo game
I'm a leave this game same way that I came
Can't waste my breath, no need to explain
50K, I wasted it, on my bracelet (Burr)
Did one walk though, we mated it
This Wasted Remix with Baby, Wayne and 'Kiss and I cremated it
(Gucci)

Rockstar lifestyle might not make it (Make it)
President got him in the White House naked (Naked)
Looked at the clock and it said right now
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Panetela dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money baby, big shit like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti bat black, where they do that at?
South beach, Miami ho
I'm probably with Tammy To (Tammy Torres)
My life is a video, and the women want that cameo
I just want them pantyhose and I'm higher than Geronimo
An I got the tools, tell 'em boys it can get mechanical

Rockstar lifestyle might don't make it (Wasted)
Livin' life high everyday, clique wasted (Wasted)

Rockstar lifestyle might not make it (Uh, uh)
Wasted, just performed "We Gon' Make It" (Yeah)
Bitches get naked off the stones in the bracelet (Haha)
Said you got coke, I brought a fiend along to taste it (Uh)
Money come fast now, we ain't gotta chase it (Nah)
Kush got a nigga feelin' like he in The Matrix
Hennessy, Patron, Grey Goose, Aces (Yeah)
Alcohol, tobacco, firearm cases (ATF)
Dufflebag double up, big faces (Stacks)
Tony Montana shit, crib spacious (Yes)
Futuristic automobiles, spaceships (Ha)
Jadakiss laced it, the remix, Wasted

Rockstar lifestyle might don't make it (Wasted)
Livin' life high everyday, clique wasted (Wasted)

Shake it for me baby girl do it butt naked (Wasted)
I'm so wasted, she so wasted (Wasted)
Tell the bartender send me twenty more cases (Yeah, nigga, we shinin' like chandeliers)

Big money, make a pearl handle with two clips
Cash Money, Young Money fly, in new whips
All white pearl, money from the earl
Poppin' Don P, iced out my baby girl
Catch me in the club with my MAC and my strap on
Bitches high rollin', white doves, gettin' they freak on
Get my clap on, get my money on
Shinin' all the time, and watch me bring it home
S-s-so she love me, how we do this?
Maybach, lay back, baby, how we do this
Lauder jet, G4, high to the sky, bitch
Mo money than I've seen, no ceilings, bitch
Rockstar lifestyle might don't make it (Yeah, wasted)
Livin' life high everyday, clique wasted (Young Moola, wasted)
Sippin' on purple stuff, rollin' up stanky (Gucci Mane, Birdman, wasted)
Wake up in the morning 10 o'clock drankin' (Brrat, y'all dig that)1Embed
