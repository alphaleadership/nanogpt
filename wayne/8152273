(JValley)
(Is this Baby E?)
I'm out of my mind, bae, let's keep on sippin'
Let's make some babies and make it official
I feel you inside, ain't no better feelin'
I throw it back against, bae, let's keep on sippin'

(Wait)
Alright, cool
Niggas ain't did how I do (Did how I do)
Niggas ain't cut how I'm cut (They ain't cut how I'm cut)
I could pull a whole slug out the slug (Yeah)
Well, miss, you gon' buss down or what? (Buss down or what)
You gon' let me get you cussed out or what? (Yeah)
Call your phone every time I touchdown or what? (Yeah)
But sometimes
Yeah, I'm just playing, you know I like to be alone when I keep two fire
How you hit that bitch alone in these streets? (Yeah)
And I ain't even gotta beat it long when we link
But she know I beat it like it was belonging to me (Belonging)
Just the right way, it ain't no wrong way to me (Wrong way)
Let that other nigga beat that shit that I don't beat
We are not the same, you ain't never found one of me
Come around, got me zoning out, bae, 'cause I'm on that (Yeah)

I'm out of my mind, bae, let's keep on sippin'
Let's make some babies and make it official
I feel you inside, ain't no better feelin'
I throw it back against, bae, let's keep on sippin'
I'm out of my mind, bae, let's keep on sippin'
Let's make some babies and make it official
I feel you inside, ain't no better feelin'
I throw it back against, bae, let's keep on sippin'

I throw it back against
I throw it back—, back
I throw it back against—, back against, back against
I throw it back against—
I throw it back—, back
I throw it back against—, back against, back against
I throw it back against—
I throw it back—, back
I throw it back against—, back against, back against
I throw it back against—
I throw it back—, back
I throw it back against, bae, let's keep on sippin'Embed
