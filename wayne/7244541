26 ContributorsYa Dig Lyrics
Can we talk about it now?
I mean the little trouble that we've been having lately
You know, I really— I really mean—
I really can’t stand the way, you know
That we're acting toward each other
It's just not right, you know

Ahem, yeah, they love me when the mic on
But then they show my dark side when the lights on
But fuck ’em in the ass with a pipe, homes
Fuck off and let me get my life on
You crackerjack, get your white on
I will send niggas to your house whilе your wife home
I'm Black and proud, right on
And since thеse lights on, let me get my bright on
Don't worry 'bout what I'm on
I own everything around me, now get the fuck from 'round me
I should pull out my dick and watch you climb on
Get the fuck up out my hair unless you're my comb
That mean mind yours because I'm grown
And I’ma die alone with my Styrofoam

I hope you can dig what I’m saying now
And please don't get mad (Uh)
You might also like
Like, get the fuck outta my business
’Cause I've been handling the fuck outta my business
Grinding, got perfect attendance
Flyer than first-class and detention
Uh, been a winner since a beginner
And my records show, now leave it in the Guinness
What do you mean, am I finished? I'm just getting started
Put you on the sideline like Vince Lombardi
Weezy, newborn baby, and it's my party
And I’m kicking like a horse on the stick-shift Ferrari
Like new cocaine, bright yellow dope
Bright red flag like a red velvet rope
I'm open for criticism
But really, is it any room for criticism? When the shit that's in 'em
Is deeper than your pool, so I swim in toilets
Bitch, I be and I been ballin', yeah

I hope you can dig what I'm saying now (Uh)
And please don't get mad

And now I'm back like spinal, attack like rhino
Got the thunder like Lion-O and leave your head spinning like vinyl
I know, psycho but tight, though
Right, ho? But you could drown in my flow 'cause my flow is a tidal
Wave, you gon' need Geico or gecko
I go get from the get-go, go let
Let go, let's go, go where? Anywhere but nowhere
Colder than a polar bear's toenail
No frail, don't break, too real
Boy, I get it poppin' like New Year's
Scream "Hallelujah", I am the one, call me new year
My car windows dark and my diamond chains too clear
Like a light blink, bitch, I wear a ice rink
Syrup pink, that ice pink, pour it up for Pimp C
Pour it up for Screw and Moe, pour it up for Bun B
Pour it up for young me, nigga
You know, I mean, it's just, you know, I just think
Maybe love to you is buying me cars, giving me money
Buying me fancy clothes4Embed
