15 ContributorsAll Night Lyrics
You know it's Wheezy (You know)
Nigga, you know it's Wheezy (You know)
You know it's Wheezy (You know)
Who Squideye

I ain't just jumped off the porch playboy
I been thuggin' on the block
Fist clutchin' on the Glock, who 'bout it
Motherfucker let me know shit
Y'all wit that ho shit, I keep the 4 grip
Hollowed tips fill the whole clip
Trippin' ya feel the whole clip, get It
I'm on some mo shit
Quad Mafia blow Shit
Never slept for dough or no bitch
I only want a ho for those lips to lick my whole clique
And load the bitch wit' coke and shit and send her on a road trip
I'm so sick wit' it
Dick nigga what is your purpose
I'm off the surface
Platinum merchandise shining perfect
For certain firearms
This verse seem like it's dirty squiddy
Put bullets in yo shirt and fitted if you jerkin wit' me
 pops don't yourself the next statistic
You may be hard but seeing your chopped off is less convincing
Which nigga want it
Holla at me I'll be at the top with cha wife slobbing on my cock
And your kids calling me pop I can't be stopped
You might also like
Okay, they run in yo place, four straight to yo face
These Niggas don't play, believe me, shit ain all right
They cut off all lights and they ridin' all night
Till some shit that you don't like let's go
Okay, they run in yo place, four straight to yo face
These Niggas don't play, believe me, shit ain all right
They cut off all lights and they ridin' all night
Till some shit that you don't like let's go

Nigga look here you can play wit' me or my dogs If ya won't
And watch how quick yo bitches wind up gettin' left faunked
I dress in black rat a tat-tat leave ya flat nigga
At any given time you gonna see that nigga
Lil Turk and Wheezy straight thugged out
We got choppers wit' fifty that'll clear it out
You could test the nuts if ya won't round
You know you done fucked up so it's goin' down
Get full of that one-on-one and we don't give a fuck
It's you or me, me or you nigga so what's up
Now tell me, is you really bout that beef shit
Bringin that heat shit, killin' yo peeps shit
Cuz If you not then it's best you stay your distance nigga
Cuz when we pull the trigger look we ain' missing nigga
I'm a hit cha in yo melon split it to the fat
Leave yo moms on the front level draped in black
Okay, they run in yo place, four straight to yo face
These Niggas don't play, believe me, shit ain all right
They cut off all lights and they ridin' all night
Till some shit that you don't like let's go
Okay, they run in yo place, four straight to yo face
These Niggas don't play, believe me, shit ain all right
They cut off all lights and they ridin' all night
Till some shit that you don't like let's go

Fuck wit' a turn or bed for bags, bitches, and bread
And we mash quickly in a drought and blast snitches they scared
Take snap pictures for feds we blast riches and ice
Snatch at night get 'em back depending the price
Livin the last minutes of life and we do it huge
My whole crew'll does whos background to screw
And we feud wit' anyone to two shatter ya cabin
Come around ya block, niggas disappear like abra cadabra, huh

Lil Turk don't play nigga look betta recognize
When my finger get ta fuckin' all you niggas gon' die
Hit cha set in camouflage 50 shots what I fire
Lay down and getcha mind right I betcha won't survive
I put that on everything against anything ya bet
If a nigga get it twisted get holes in his chest
 vest ain no way you protect it
Last nigga got bust up cuz he disrespected
Okay, they run in yo place, four straight to yo face
These Niggas don't play, believe me, shit ain all right
They cut off all lights and they ridin' all night
Till some shit that you don't like let's go
Okay, they run in yo place, four straight to yo face
These Niggas don't play, believe me, shit ain all right
They cut off all lights and they ridin' all night
Till some shit that you don't like let's goEmbed
