Rock, rock, and you don't stop, c'mon
Nappy Boy
It's Travie! T-Pain
Yeah

Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (How you doing?)
You are forever stuck to me
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (How you doing?)
You are forever stuck to me

Remember when rocking with tattoo's wasn't so cool?
I used to spend my time planning out my sleeves in school
Mind you, this was back in the early 90's
At the local tattoo shop was where you can find me
Now I was like everybody in they mama's covert
Like here's a bag of tattoos, just add water
Then she walked in painted from head to feet
I said, "That's the type of girl that I have to meet"

Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me

She played tough, but I could tell she was feeling the kid
But deep down, she didn't even know she was killing the kid
I was only fifteen she was that times two
She had full color black and gray, fine line too
Where the portrait of Bettie Page on her right shoulder
I said, "Damn, I can't wait until I get older"
But for now, I guess I'll just sit and observe
And hope I pray that one day, I might build up the nerve
And say...

Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me

Alright now, let's fast forward a couple of years
We going hard, working on my tattoo career
One day I looked up half way though a piece (Forever)
And it was Ms. Tattoo girl staring at me
She said, "Hey, I remember you from back in the day"
I said, "Yeah, the chubby kid without a word to say"
She said, "Damn, you grew up, man, time sure flying
You can hurry up on her 'cause I'm your next client
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me
You are forever stuck to me
You are forever stuck to meEmbed
