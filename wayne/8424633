Hurricanes, hurricane
Hurricanes, hurricane (Oh, oh-my-my)
When I wake up to the sound of it rainin'
I can't stop it, I can hear you complainin'
Hurricanes, hurricane
Hurricanes, hurricane (Oh-my-my)

All my users, all my devices
Can't hear me anymore, how I'm losin'
Waste my time making things right
Waste my time, Waste my time, I will start again
'Cause I'm trying to realize how I am
And I'm sure of that dream
And if you wanna, you can just go ahead
I know that you know that it's true
You can just say that it's true
But I'm sure of what you mean
You're never going to wake me up
Can't you hear the time? Pow-pow, ooh
If you think I'm doing you a more a fool
Yeah, we're not that far from the truth
I will close the door but, before I walk out of you
I will close the door but, before I walk out of you
I am a road maps journey with me on my knees
I am road maps journey with you on your knees

Hurricanes, hurricane
Hurricanes, hurricane (Oh, oh-my-my)
When I wake up to the sound of it rainin'
I can't stop it, I can hear you complainin'
Hurricanes, hurricane
Hurricanes, hurricane (Oh-my-my)

I don't want to be all alone
You'll be me in another lifetime
And you'll be the last one by my side
I won't be the one to say goodnight
I've lost the one who saved me
I've turned into some other side
I've become the voice you speak
I had to kill someone to find a girl
Who loves me more than they do
Someone to kiss and you know I'm talking to you
One more time and I will be here forever
And when I end that book look at you
Now I won't have to write it down

Hurricanes, hurricane
Hurricanes, hurricane (Young Mula!)
When I wake up to the sound of it rainin'
I can't stop it, I can hear you complainin'
Hurricanes, hurricane
Hurricanes, hurricane
I was thinking that my bunk would always be the safe one
But I should think again, about being locked up inside your bunk
Yes, I think that your little tantrum got me to think again about you again
It's free, and it's sad, when a man triples it's out there
I'm not saying I'm wrong, I'm not that innocent
But what I am saying is people are speaking their mind all the time
They're acting stupidly just to have it (Have, have)

It's only natural but you gotta understand
You're only human and that's a fact (Ya know)
You're only human and we're a thing
You're only human we're a thing
You're only human just try (Yeah, ooh-ooh)

I know you hear me calling then
You know I'm no good at calling
I'm no good at calling
I am no good at calling
You know I'm a liar, a liar
You know I tried to tell myself this
The truth, the truth has come out
This is all you've been told
You know I was the one who won
Believe me, now it's over
I should have known that
I could not live this story without you
You know I tried to tell myself this
You know I was the one who won
Believe me, now it's over
I should have known that
I should have known that
You're always the only thing I see
So I get scared when you get close
And I'm scared to death in spiders web
If I can stay all of her time
The way that she makes me want to grab
Baby you say he's just a fool
But she doesn't really have a clue
Well I'm a little bit jealous, hey
But they're always in my mind
It can be so foggy in a bubble
Caught in a spin and a fly
Can't take what I give

Hurricanes, hurricane
Hurricanes, hurricane
When I wake up to the sound of it rainin'
I can't stop it, I can hear you complainin'
Hurricanes, hurricane
Hurricanes, hurricaneEmbed
