2 ContributorsDown Here LyricsYou know about the hot boys nigga, you know about the hot boys nigga
Nigga say New Orleans fake, nigga better fear down here
We have mo' murders than the days and a year down here
You got coke we'd a make ya disappear down here
You outta line we'd a leave ya block clear down here
If you ain't from here, you better not come live down here
We drank champagne we don't fuck with beer down here
We straight snakes we come at'cha from the rear down here
We straight guerrillas you get it how you live down here
I'ma chopper toter I ain't never showed no fear
I duct tape ya rope ya and cut ya from ear ta ear
B Geezy is one of the hottest niggas in the pad
Get outta line with me and I'll leave ya shit flat
Clickin' and clackin' blacka and bangin' ridin' at night
Jackin' and slangin' hustlin' and peerin' man that's my life
Baby, slim, fresh, juve, weezy, turk, that's my clique
Disrespect 'em a get 'cha call ta the morgue quick nigga
You know about the hot boys
Disrespect 'em a get a call ta the morgue quick
I come with, K's and Glocks, ready ta spray the block
Raise the spot, blica-blazin' hot
See I'm the, youngest C.M.B. nigga holly grove hard hitter
Get rid of niggas if you come with the correct scrilla
I'm on de'netha dela it turn me ta killer
Say it's a shame 'cause Wayne an untamed guerrilla
You might also likeYa got the dope and ya-ya you drop it like it burn
I get that rope and tape and I gotta have yurn
I know I'm raw I know I'm out thea' bad
But I get it how I live 'cause that drought ain't playin'
And I'm 'bout that cash, so I can bounce back fast
So I gotta dress in black with dirty Reboks and mask
Pass me the smell of braise let me blow out my brain
I'm on the block, hotter than a trench ready ta do it again
Lil' weezy hot boy have you feelin' the flames
'Cause these blood stains, in ya, Hilfiger my man
I ain't with that bull shittin' lil' one so take heave
I ain't gonna stop until all of you bitches leave
You mothafuckin' right I got a complex
You mothafuckin' right I'm takin' hits, with a contract
Been in nigga everywhere but under the foots
I'm try'na take lil' daddy head outta the roots
I'll catch him in the broad daylight I won't give a fuck
Find me a illegal dice game we gon' fuck it up
Because niggas, try they best, ta catch me
But I ain't, gonna let 'em, stretch me
I'm not, abouta run, 'cause I'm a soulja
I keeps, me a gun, when in that nolia
My tongue, never lose, 'cause I'm a fool
Ask a nigga who bout it, them AK's rule
You better not be running through niggas that I despise
Catch you off ya bases leave the murder rate high
Uptown is where I'm from Magnolia soulja 'til I die
Keep a chopper with a drum realest they come ready ta ride
I never been a hoe nigga I been 'bout drama
Never hung with the young niggas I run with the ol' timers
Nigga want start something won't talk about you bring it
If you up weight it don't stunt we leave you banged
You didn't say you didn't, be a man don't be no hoe
If you live by the gun then by the gun is how you go
Niggas don't fight no more all they do is slang that iron
Niggas they killin' slow that's how it go in
Ain't no rules too this shit spread when you wan' spread it
Shoot then talk later play it how you wan' play it
You got a problem with me nigga we can do it how you wanna
Spin a bend in broad daylight and I bet'cha you be a goner
Shit nigga I'm goin' all out behind mine
Burn your block down, at any given time nigga, what?
Nigga, what? Nigga, what? Nigga, what? we come na tear it up, what?1Embed
