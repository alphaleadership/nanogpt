14 ContributorsPoppinâ€™ (Remix) Lyrics
Chris Breezy
I see ya, daddy

Yeah, right off the bat, I'm a mack
We can get it poppin', we can get it crackin'
And if your man is whack
And if he lack what I pack
Then I will make you lack him
Shorty, we can do what you wanna, how you wanna
Where you wanna, when you wanna, ask them
And my clip never droppin'
We can get it poppin' like a MAC-10
Brrrr that, that, that on your back, back, back
I smack, smack, smack that
And I'm strapped with an automatic tongue
And it goes brrrr-a-da-da-da
Now who wanna get shot? Baby, I could tap that
Yup, I could tap that like the Rat Pack
I could lay back like a fat cat
But I'm a big dog on any track
Ah, and we got it pumpin' e'ry night, e'ry night
When we did the tour thing
You know I had to tell them young niggas
When it come to the women, I just switch like a mood ring
But I'm rich, I'm high on the food chain
I'm hot, I smoke like two trains
I'm trained, I know how to do things
My thing is hot like blue flame
Flame, the fireman put it out
She hot, the fireman put her out
All she gotta do is call up emergency
And I will be on my way to the house
Knock, knock? I know somebody home
Don't leave me knockin', baby
All you gotta do is bring that corn
And we can get it poppin', baby

How you doin', baby? Nice to meet ya
Wait, let me not mislead ya
First off, I'm about my dough and cheese
Just call me a slice of pizza
Yup, I'll be your pizza guy
Deliver your pizza pie (Pie)
I got a chauffeur named Woodrow
Car named Bentley
When I speak, he drives (Let's go)
Shorty know how to work it like a model (Yeah)
She get it poppin' like a cork on a bottle (Yeah)
Baby, if you was a car
I'd put your doors in the air like a Murcielago (Yeah)
I leave you on a higher note
Then when Mariah Carey hit her highest note
You get diagnosed with a higher dose
Of what you never had before, me
Plus I ain't like them other guys that be cryin' broke (Nope)
Whinin' broke (Nope)
I'm about my bread, you heard what I said
Baby, I'm a loaf (Loaf)
Come let me school ya
Bring it here, let me be your tutor
We can go to Miami, ride down Collins, hop on that scooter
Next thing you know we be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
In the back of my Maserati
Then I drop you off before curfew time, the kind of guy I be
Oh, I'm so kind
Them other guys are not like me
So don't pay them no mind (Nope)
Uh-uh!

Shawty, shawty
The way you wearing that top, got your boy so hot
Ain't no mistaking, playing, or faking
You got me open and waiting, and poppin'
You keep me on, man, poppin'
Ooh, ooh4Embed
