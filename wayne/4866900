9 ContributorsTake It Slow Lyrics
Catch the wall girl, catch the wall girl

You got friends I ain't sure about
Motormouths talkin' 'bout what they ain't sure about
I vote em out, fuck them hoes, they a dark cloud
It's pourin' down and what she ain't tryna go through
We go around, damn, why we gotta turn down?
Learn how good dick'll turn your world around
Deserve a crown on my shit and a turban how
I put it down and the liquor make you run your mouth
You broke it down
And everything we spoke about, it won't get out
And even though I know you're down
You punkin' out
And after I get all aroused, I'm calmin’ down
That's why we always fallin' out, girl (Girl, girl)

There's-there-there-there's something I want to tell you, tell you
There's something I think that you should know
I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow

Huh, you got a ass like whoa now, profound
But you tellin' me to slow down, oh wow
You don't say that when them hoes 'round
'Cause you want them hoes to know, huh
I found love and you co-found
You might also like
Why we gotta turn down a match made
In heaven never burn out, just ask the clouds
You got me playin' cat and mouse, what's that about?
Teach you how to love 'til you get a cap and gown
But you givin' me the runaround, honey child
"I love you" are strong words, I'm muscle bound
And you tell me to settle down, let's settle down
But before I put the peddle down, you let me down, girl

There's-there-there-there's something I want to tell you, tell you (Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl)
There's something I think that you should know
I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
Catch the wall girl, catch the wall girl

Huh, you got a ass like whoa now, poke out
But you tellin' me to slow down, oh wow
You don't say that when them hoes 'round
'Cause you want them hoes to know now
Make me tell them hoes no now

But we gotta slow down 'cause you hearin' that I ho around
Don't feed into it like a closed mouth
Make me put my soul out
Girl, you so cold, get your snowplowed
I got the spirit like a ghost town, spirit like a ghost town
This dope dick will have you doped out
My boxer draws' like a dope house
While you tryna hold out, I'm tryna fuck around the whole house
I'm so for real like a fold-out
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Ooh, she on a handstand
Ooh, she on a handstand
Ooh, she on a handstand
Pop-pop, p-poppin' on a handstand
And then you
Catch the, catch the wall girl
You gotta catch the, catch the wall girl
She shake-shake that ass though
She gon' shake-shake that ass though
Ass like whoa now, so round
She tellin' me to slow down, oh wow
She don't say that when them hoes 'round
'Cause she want them hoes to know now
She just like to see them hoes pout
Why we gotta turn down? Wild out
I'm just tryna have a turned out, why not?
I don't know what she worrin' 'bout
Concerned 'bout, "I'ma let it all work out"
Girl

There's-there-there-there's something I want to tell you, tell you
There's something I think that you should know
I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
I'ma let it all work out, girl
There-there's something I want to tell you, tell you
There's something I think that you should know
I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
I'ma let it all work out, girl
There-there's something I want to tell you, tell you
There's something I think that you should know
I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
I'ma let it all work out, girl4Embed
