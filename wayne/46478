6 ContributorsYes We Do Lyrics
(Let's go, fuck wit' me)
Weezy Wee nigga, lets go, oh oh oh oh, do it, do it
HB's nigga, we run the streets nigga,lets go (Oh, oh)
We run the streets nigga (Oh, oh, uh ha oh) Weezy We my nigga (Oh, oh)
HB's dawg (Oh, oh, uh ha, oh), let's go (Oh, oh), let's go (Oh,oh)
What you know nigga, what you know about the streets
Nigga what you know, huh what you know, look, look, listen

I'm like a dry rubber wit tight pussy, ya can't fuck wit me
An if ya try, I'm bustin' get it I'm bustin'
You niggas don't amount to nothin' and me, I'm top notch boy
Any problems I cock, Glock sparks and knock out hearts
You see the ice twink we I talk, ya blink and ya dead
I'll let a hollow tip sink in ya head, so think it over
'Fore they find ya ass hangin' over a bridge and shit
While I'm out drinkin' wit the squad like I ain't did the shit
I really hope ya click come back for revenge and shit
I'll make bullets drop on ya block like pidgeon shit
A nigga duct tape ya **** don't get me pissed
Put hollow tips in clips like chips in dip
Bitch nigga here could flip the script, ya not built for dat
Ya not soldiers, ya get killed for dat
I'll cock and pop one in you cattle, push your filta back
An niggas respect the shots, make 'em tilt your hat (What you)

My name still B.G., we it's said it rang a bell
In rich neighborhoods, middle class hoods, and jails
I'm a street nigga, sold ounces of crack cocaine
If I spit it, I did it, before I got in this rap game
One of my hobbies is beef, do that for pleasure
It's nothin' to bust a head, put a few wholes in ya sweater
Never get in a situation wit me involvin' guns
Never able to sleep always on the run
One way or another you gonna come
Outta isolation, if it mean killin' ya ****
You thinkin' cause I'm rappin' and be on television
That I won't soften ya head and come split it
Close range is fake, bustin' from a distance
The shit I'm talkin' my nigga, I'm still livin'
If any nigga want it, can get it wit no problem
All these niggas playin' but me, I come to stop it
You don't want no trouble nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
And you don't want no beef nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
You don't wanna hustle nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
And you don't want no drama nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do

I don't play nigga
Better watch what ya say nigga
'Cause I fuck up ya day nigga
Wit' this K nigga I gets very low down
Give a fuck about a nigga, hit 'em wit fifty rounds
I'm from uptown, young and thuggin' since I was small
Grew up around killas, hung wit the big dawgs
Nigga we play it raw as it go, were I stay
Run ya mouth too much, get found in a hall way
Wit a head shot, look that's how niggas get it
Keep it on a tuck, nobody know who did it
No evidence, no witness, you just assed out
Busta ass nigga, you just assed out
Fuckin' wit a guerilla ah untamed one at that
You leave ya house in ya want I bet ya won't make it back
You could believe that, look betta get it right
Get it twisted if ya want, I betcha gonna loose ya life nigga
You don't want no trouble nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
And you don't want no beef nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
You don't wanna hustle nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
And you don't want no drama nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do (Uh ha, yo, yo)

All I know is dope slangin' and gang bangin'
Inglewood Cali swangin' and hood hangin'
I'm a ghetto nigga, saggin', starched, and creased
Wit everythang fa' sale from a ki to a quarter piece
Like Baby Birdman, got the game on lock
An while them youngstas workin' the block, I'm, cookin' a flock
I'm ballin' and if I'm beefin', I layed for 'em
But the murders committed recently, I paid for 'em
I got a crew of noodle knockers that'll wait in the bushes
Wet you up and have you bitches blood runnin' like douches
I'm bout murda, murda, dope, dope, leave bitch niggas no hope
Don't need a red beam cause we sight 'em wit' the scope
Yeah you talk that shit, then grab a gun nigga
But if Mack call the shot, it's good as done nigga
Cause the base from the .44 be bangin' like a drum
An it's cash Money blood, so fuck where you from nigga

You don't want no trouble nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
And you don't want no beef nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
You don't wanna hustle nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
And you don't want no drama nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
You don't want no trouble nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
And you don't want no beef nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
You don't wanna hustle nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we do
And you don't want no drama nigga, yes we do
Come on tell the truth nigga, man yes we doEmbed
