This the remix
And it's three milli on the wrist
Real life (Another one)
You know we inspired you
We set trends
(Bordeaux & Non Native)
We set for life
We the biggest

Bitch, I'm a trendsetter, bitch, I'm a dipsetter
I got the heat with me, I got a temp-setter
I got a sun-setter, yeah, that's the Beretta
This shit a breeze to me, I watch the wind settle
I took a mood sеtter, then I felt too sеttled
I took a re-setter, now I feel too better
These niggas knew better, these niggas know better
After the fumes settle, after the smoke settle
I'm still a go-getter, cause I'm a goal-setter
I like her throat wetter, she said my drip wetter
Hold up it get better, I left her clit wetter
That bitch in bed wit' her, I had to swim set her
Bitch I'm a jet setter, fly with no wind pressure
Bitch I'm a scene-setter, I got the strap on the AK I swing-set 'em
I'm a sight-setter, I was fly before you had a flight set up, I'm trendy
We set the trends, got it out the mud, nigga we had to cleanse
One at their heads, nigga we at their brims
Niggas actin' like bitches, leave that to them
Bugatti Veyron, harder than iron
I been a dog, you been a hydrant
I raised these niggas, now gimme my flowers
Daisies nigga (Tunechi)
You might also like
We set the trends (Trends, trends)
Bringin' in ends (Bringin' in cash, ends)
I'ma have to call my accountant to make sure this shit came in (This the remix, brrt)
It's just me and my gang (Gang)
Fuck niggas, we don't do friends (Fuck)
What he say? He want smoke? (Smoke)
We gon' spin (Brrt), spin again (Uh, uh, uh)

Ayy, I know how to get it, the Maybach is kitted
My drip is exquisite, my style is prolific
My gun come with switches
I stand on the business, as God is my witness
She say you want smoke, and I'm granting your wishes
Oh, that's your ho? And she thinks I'm delicious
Show 'em what they doing
I show you I did it, showed them how to do it
They hate to admit it (Yeah)
Don't show me that bitch cause I already hit it
Don't show me a million, I already spent it
They know how I'm coming, they know that I'm with it
All of that capping, get one in your fitted (Bah)
It's been a while, been away for a minute
The platform was mine I don't take what I'm given
Gave 'em a head start now I'm shaving the distance
Need mines with interest to be more specific (Ayy)
They know the drill, we set the trends
We don't just ball, we bend the rims (Yeah)
Ten toes tall, we stand to win (Win)
They are not us, we are not them (No)
We been doin' this, where do I begin? (Where?)
Where do I start, where do I end? (Where?)
When they come to work, they just pretend
We put it in like we in the gym
Don't walk up this street 'cause you might lose a limb
Blood on my Tims, so what you can swim? (So what?)
This water's reserved for sharks, remember I told you before you jump in (Ayy, ayy)
We set the trends (Trends, trends)
Bringin' in ends (Bringin' in cash, ends)
I'ma have to call my accountant to make sure this shit came in (Brrt)

First, I showed 'em how to bang and I showed 'em how to ball
First nigga that was rocking that Supreme (Eastside)
Shit, I'm back in my bag, all this  on my body and I'm thinking about copping a machine
Got a choppa in my jeans, used to sell rocks to the fiends
I just bought a drop off of streams
Just pumping on the block, man, we're chartering shit
I be jumping off the yacht with my team
Got a Glock with the beam
Everybody know we the trendiest (Thirty)
This watch on my wrist caught a M this year (Damn)
Last deal I got caught a M this year
Niggas wanna start, we gon' end the shit
Still in the meeting you'd think I was Khaled
Fuck validation, my nigga, I'm valid
 and we keeping this dirty
Keep it a bucky, the heat got the thirty
You can mention New York, you don't mention the set
Beef in your state, we gon' spin in the jet (Nyoom)
All of this water, you can swim in my chest
Ask all the hoes, they say Jim is a mess
We gon' keep spinning like a bottle top (Spin em')
Brand new thing and it ain't got a top (Ooh)
Niggas keep playing 'til a body drop
We gon' make it hot on the hottest block
We set the trends (Trends, trends)
Bringin' in ends (Bringin' in cash, ends)
I'ma have to call my accountant to make sure this shit came in (This the remix, brrt)
It's just me and my gang (Gang)
Fuck niggas, we don't do friends (Fuck)
What he say? He want smoke? (Smoke)
We gon' spin (Brrt), spin again1Embed
