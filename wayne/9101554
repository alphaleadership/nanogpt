Ayy, formula, bitch
So if you comin' for me, lil' bitch
Just know I got an army, lil' bitch, and we in the field like a farmer, you bitch
I don't need a shield, don't need armor, you bitch
For real, real, life phenomenal, bitch
Rhyme tight like a corner, lil' bitch
Shine bright, make your cornea itch
Alright, okay, yes, sir
Call me, "Weezy F1"
My car fly like the Jetson's
You a small fry, need ketchup
Fall behind or you can catch up
You can fall down or you can step up
Been a long time since I messed up
I told Father Time I'm his step-son
Got 'em braided like Lewis
Got a Mercedes like Lewis
I ain't in the latest, I'm in the newest
And if I ain't the greatest, tell me, who is?
No cappin', do the dash, no toe-tappin'
Your girl my co-captain
Drivin' like Max Verstappen
This my world, I'm your champion
I got the formula, baby
Mix it like Arnold Palmer, lil' baby
Had a grill before Formula, baby
On them trees like an ornament, baby
Engine soundin' like harmony, baby
Yeah, fast lane, godspeed
Lil Wayne, victory lane
Got champagne on me, gone
This is the formula
This is the formula
I got the formula
This is the formula (One)
All I do is go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Y'all boys too slow, slow
Stay in your lane
Stay in your lane (Stay in your lane)
Stay in your lane (Stay in your lane)
Stay in your lane (Stay in your lane)
Stay in your lane (Ayy, ayy)
All I do is go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Y'all boys too slow, slow
Stay in your lane

All I do is go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
It's time to go, bitch
Yo, I got that solid gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold
Gold, gold, gold, gold
I'm solid gold, bitch
Ayy, all I do is win it and win it, I been winnin' since the beginnin'
I'm never locked in it, and I got too much energy, energy, energy
That's what I'm sendin', ayy
Crush up my enemies, ayy
I multiply, here go ten of mes, uh
William, william, a milli', a million
Too many feet like a centipede, ayy, uh
All I do is work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
I been workin', bitch
All I do is whip it, whip it, whip-whip, whip it, whip it, whip-whip, whip it
