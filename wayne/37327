48 ContributorsDuffle Bag Boy Lyrics
(Yeah) Weed and syrup 'til I die (Okay)
(M16) New Playaz Circle
As a matter of fact, it's gon' kill me, bitch
'Cause you ain't, ha (Tell 'em, shawty)
So get high (Tell 'em, Weezy, bah, bah)
Or get low, yeah

If I don't do nothin', I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall
Now go and get your money, little duffle bag boy
Said go and get your money, little duffle bag boy
Get money
I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure ain't 'bout to pick today to start runnin'
Look, honey
I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure ain't 'bout to pick today to start runnin'
Get money (Okay)

The beat so hot, the flow is so ice cold
Walk into the Gucci store, honey, I'm home
I am on my shit, I need a Pamper on (Yeah)
Toilet paper on the side for example, homie
I get money
I know you niggas ain't heard no shit like this
And while you wishing on that fallin' star
I'm in a foreign car, smokin' out with the doors ajar
Suede sunroof, hangin' out the big top (Top)
We leave the dealership, head to the rim shop (Shop)
You niggas barely dressing, I got thousands piling
That's that salad dressing, I'm on my Thousand Island
Wildin', styling, I be
I get so much money, it's my I.D., don't try me
And if I don't do nothin', I'ma fuckin' ball
And I ain't 'bout to start runnin', naw, nigga, naw (Yeah)

If I don't do nothin', I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall
Now go and get your money, little duffle bag boy
Said go and get your money, little duffle bag boy
Get money
And I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure ain't 'bout to pick today to start runnin'
Look, honey
I said I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure ain't 'bout to pick today to start runnin'
Get money

Ain't nothin' to a boss, we ballin' when you see us
We hear them haters callin', they too far off to see us
Unless they got they glasses on, get your bifocal game
Class is now in session, now try to stay focused, mane
Your boy ain't good enough, style ain't hood enough
Would've could've should've won't do with us, true enough
Meet a ho, break a ho, never nothin' new to us
Turnin' hoes to housewives never been cool with us
Soon enough, all these dealers is gonna catch up
'Til then, fuck it, I'm winning, so I'ma stack up
Flows like the river, the current is so rapid
Hit with the ratchet, that's how shit happens
Next time you're yappin', make sure it be about big money talk
Let that lil' money walk (Yeah)
Call me what you want, but don't call me for fronts (Yeah)
Southside, I got what you want, come holla at me
If I don't do nothin', I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall
Said go and get your money, little duffle bag boy
Now go and get your money, little duffle bag boy
And baby, I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure ain't 'bout to pick today to start runnin'
Look, honey, I said I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure ain't 'bout to pick today to start runnin'
Get money
And if I don't do nothin', I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall
Said go and get your money, little duffle bag boy
Now go and get your money, little duffle bag boy
Get money
And I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure ain't 'bout to pick today to start runnin'
Get money
I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure ain't 'bout to pick today to start runnin'
