Tunechi!

Okay
Death is in the alley, life is in my pocket
I break it down and sell it, does that make me a profit?
There's too much weight to carry
Ye, I walk through the valley
Damn, when it rains, it storms like Halle
Man, I don't know the future
But I know where I'm going
Don't know when I'll get there
But I know that I get there
God bless America, I hope he hears my prayers
There's a stairway to heaven, but people under the stairs
Love is in the air, pollution everywhere
Love is such a fucking illusion, its never there
So in my spare time, I don't have time to spare
So I put on a condom and happily fuck, yeah
Fu-fu-fuck Yeah

Alright, alright
Colorful reality, everything is beautiful
Simply refuse to get used to the usual
Life tastes sweet and even sweeter with the freedom
But be careful with belief, cause you are what you believe in
You might also likeNow it's me against the world, and I just want to get even
In the belly of the beast and somebody gotta feed it
We get a train of thought, and then that train leave us
And we can't have tricks up our sleeves if we are sleeveless
That's because we bear arms, watch my rebels swarm
Dreadlocks only to hide my devil horns
Life is but a bitch, she'll go fuck you and leave you
If you think its sweet, I knock out your fucking sweet tooth
Tunechi
