13 ContributorsPolitics (Lethal Injection) Lyrics
So you didn't get drafted by the NBA, but you got drafted to defend your U.S.A
Now you got war on your mind, put you on front line and you will die, die, the American way

So I woke up at the crack of dawn, a lot going through my mind while I stretch and yawn
Its a love-hate thing, but my heart is torn, man, let me just speak about whats going on
Hey, Dear Mr. President, why you got our troops in the war and they fighting over shit thats irrelevant
While the crime rates spread like an infection, Im trying to duck jail and a lethal injection

Love, hate, size, race, crime, grace, lip injection, lethal injection
Breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction
Breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction
Love, hate, size, race, crime, grace, crime rate, lip injection, lethal injection
Lip injection, lethal injection, breast reduction, police corruption
Your assumption, economical destruction, breast reduction
Police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction

What is your fucking problem, I'm from the fucking bottom
I got a bunch of problems, and can't nothing solve them
My room is full of demons, I ain't afraid of them
I hear them witches screaming, I raise a blade to them

Love, hate, size, race, crime, grace, lip injection, lethal injection
Breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction
Breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction
Love, hate, size, race, crime, grace, crime rate, lip injection, lethal injection
Lip injection, lethal injection, breast reduction, police corruption
Your assumption, economical destruction, breast reduction
Police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction

So you didn't get drafted by the NBA, but you got drafted to defend your U.S.A
Now you got war on your mind, put you on front line and you will die, die, the American way

Question, what the fuck is you go do, when that new world come for you
When that new world come for you, revolution is never the solution
Prostitution, drug distribution, war contribution, all for the love of the constitution
Yeah

Love, hate, size, race, grime, grace, lip injection, lethal injection
While the crime rates spread like an infection, Im trying to duck jail and a lethal injection
Love, hate, size, race, grime, grace, crime rate, lip injection, lethal injection
Lip injection, lethal injection, breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption
Economical destruction, breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction2Embed
