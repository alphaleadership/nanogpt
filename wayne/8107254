1 ContributorUproar (Remix) LyricsRayne Storm, Lil Wayne, Loudpack
Been a long time coming, run the soundtrack
Real dap, give a pound back
One man Russian roulette, if it sound wack
Bad bitch, round ass
Told them hoes get lost once I found that
You from what town, nigga Uptown
Harlem world, im just tryna bring the sound back
That's a sound fact, like the truth told
I shot my shot there, I was too bold
I got top there, I was too cold
I left my tots there, like a group home 
Bring the troops home, send a real vet
Mother fuck death, now that's a real threat
Imma get mines, thats a real bet 
I'm first 48, you first date, ain't kill yet
Betta chill yes, or get laid down
Jacking mine'll get it jumping like a playground 
Nah I dont play around, like a pendulum 
But I get to swinging, If you mention em
This a special one, peep the delivery 
Even with infinity 
Still couldn't get rid of me
Light skin mini me's
Studied up on little me
You did that but not like stizzy
Peep the history
Its Being made You might also likeEmbed
