Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Hit the lights
Oh-oh-oh
Hit the lights
Oh-oh-oh
Hit the lights
Oh-oh-oh
Hit the lights, hit the lights

Baby, hold it
And let me holla at you, baby, for a moment
And if you with it, I’m with it, we'll keep it rollin’
And we’ll be dancin' and drinkin' until the morning
Until the morning, morning
Starters going off
It’s so hot, there’s girls just taking all there clothes off
So take a picture of this moment with your iPhone
'Cause I don’t wanna forget tonight, night, night

Put your lighters in the air
Let 'em burn into the night
And let everybody know
That you're with it and your ready to go
You might also like
So hit the lights (Oh, oh, oh)
Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Tonight, tonight
So Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the light (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the light
Hit the lights

Come out the dark and let the DJ lead the way (way, way,)
'Cause it’s hot in the club now, so don’t let it stop now
So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights (And everybody say)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

YMCMB, bitches call me Tunechi Li
All them bitches think they fly and all them bitches flew to me
Hit the lights so you could see
My drink is strong, my hookah sweet
Understand the time is now, but time is up, the future's bleak
This beat is stupid, cupid
Love me, leave me in the morning
If you like, your friend can join in
The wildest flower in the garden
Coolest nigga in the party, shades on, dreads long
Blood gang, red zone and I’m with Jay Sean
Put your lighters in the air
Let 'em burn into the sky
And let everybody know
That you're with it and your ready to go

So hit the lights (Oh, oh, oh)
Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Tonight, tonight
So Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the light (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the light
Hit the lights

Come out the dark and let the DJ lead the way (way, way, way)
'Cause it’s hot in the club now, so don’t let it stop now
So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
And everybody say
Tell 'em low, tell 'em high (Tell 'em low, tell 'em high)
Light it up to the sky (Light it up to the sky)
Tell 'em low, tell 'em high (Tell 'em low, tell 'em high)
Light it up to the sky (Light it)

And everybody say
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

So hit the lights (Oh, oh, oh)
Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Tonight, tonight
So Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the lights (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the light (Oh-oh-oh)
Hit the light
Hit the lights

Come out the dark and let the DJ lead the way (Way, way)
'Cause it’s hot in the club now, so don’t let it stop now
(Don’t let it stop now)
So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights (Hit the lights)Embed
