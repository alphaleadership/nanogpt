Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui
Ooh, la, la

Yeah, uh
Ooh, la, la, it's Young Mula-la
Me no do ra-ra, boom-boom, kumbaya
Vroom-vroom, zoom by ya, me and all me goon brada
Mario Brother shroom power make me doom-doom-da-da
Bougie thot, I call her Bougie Banton
She like sushi and opera, but her coochie aqua
What's a goon to a goblin? What's a shooter to a shotter?
I could boom shakalaka your medulla oblongata
Kill a mic like El-P and Killer Mike, feeling like
DJ Premier, it's my world premiere tonight, feeling right
Hair trigger softer than a pillow fight
No computer, but this MAC got more shots than gigabytes
Bigger teeth, bigger bite, bigger holes in the wall
Money tall, ego small, blunt as long as a log
Mask is off, nothin' to lose, classy God, Sunday school
Run up a chеck and run your mouth, we run you down, Run The Jewеls
Lil Tune

Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui (Ah, oui, oui)
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui (Mon cheri, mon cheri)
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui
Ooh, la, la

Lookin' for M's like I lost a friend
Jump out of my bed like, "Where the bread?"
You gon' hold the egg, waiter bring the check
When we talk, we Kalashnikov, keep us in your thoughts
Fully dressed at the crack of dawn, weapons letting off
I can hear them from the block, see them creeping through the fog
Season's greetings, now feeding season can start, oh my God
Look alive, lookin' like I live life on a crooked line
Doin' fine, you want maximum stupid, I am the guy

First of all, fuck the fuckin' law, we is fuckin' raw
Steak tartare, oysters on the half-shell, sushi bar
Life a bitch and the pussy fish, still fucked her raw
I'm a dog, I'm a dirty dog, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ol' Dirty Bastard, go in your jaw, shimmy shimmy ya
Got the semi in the hemi, goin', "Gimme, gimme, y'all"
Pugilistic, my linguistics are Jeru the Damaja
And I rap it pornographic, bitch, set up the camera
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui (I need a bottle of Moët, ho, come on)
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui (Garçon)

You covet disruption, I got you covered, I'm bustin' (Bustin')
My brother's a runner, he crushin', it's no discussion ('Scussion)
I used to be munchkin, I wasn't 'posed to be nothin' (Nothin')
Y'all fuckers corrupted and up to somethin' disgusting
My pockets are plumper this season, I love to cuff 'em
I'm afraid of nothin' but nothingness, ain't it something?
Warmongers are dumpin', they'll point and click at your pumpkin (Look out)
Your suffering is scrumptious, they'll put your kids in the oven

Fuck a king or queen and all of they loyal subjects
I pull my penis out and I piss on they shoes in public
People, we the pirates, the pride of this great republic
No matter what you order, motherfucker, we what you're stuck with (Sorry)
I used to love Bruce, but livin' my vida loca
Helped me understand I'm probably more of a Joker
When we usher in chaos, just know that we did it smiling
Cannibals on this island, inmates run the asylum
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la, la (DJ Premier)

Ooh, la, la
Ooh, la— la, la
Ooh— ooh
Ooh— ooh, la, la, ah, oui, oui
Ooh— la— la— la— la, la
La— la— la— la— la— la— la
Ah, oui— ah, oui— ah
Ah— ah, oui, oui1Embed
