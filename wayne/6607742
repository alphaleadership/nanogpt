Ayy-hey
(Hey-hey)
Ah-ah, ah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Ayy, I'm just tryna vibe, so I'm rolling up (Ayy, rolling up)
We was living way too fast but we ain't know enough (Ain't know enough)
Might have to get him off the path, if he try to slow me up
And I got this glizzy in this bag, boy, I might blow you up (Might blow you up)
And there's more than fifty when we slide, you know them riders rough (Them riders rough)
If he playin' silly 'bout that bag, then we might tie him up
Remember we was fucked up, walkin' Sibley, we ain't have enough (We ain't have enough)
We tryna get some cake, these niggas hatin', they was mad at us (They was mad at us)

Through the dark, hoodie on, like I'm Trayvon (Like I'm Trayvon)
I got shooters like the hoopers in my hood, like K. Nunn (Like K. Nunn)
Playin' victim, you know what you did, why you play dumb?
Crazy thing, my niggas knew about it, they ain't say nothin' (They ain't say nothin')
This Percocet gon' get me higher (Higher)
I go to sleep and get to talkin' to Lerayah (Lerayah)
She said, "Relax, my brodie, I've been sendin' my love"
You tryna kill yourself, that's gon' result to fire
Feed your soul like Lauryn Hill and some Wyclef
Pray to the Lord, he give me guidance and the right steps (The right steps)
My shorties wild and they get live up in the night, yeah (The night, yeah)
I'm from the darkness, baby, I'm so used to nightmares (Feed your soul)

Ayy, I'm just tryna vibe, so I'm rolling up (Ayy, rolling up)
We was living way too fast but we ain't know enough (Ain't know enough)
Might have to get him off the path, if he try to slow me up
And I got this glizzy in this bag, boy, I might blow you up (I might blow you up)
And there's more than fifty when we slide, you know them riders rough (Them riders rough)
If he playin' silly 'bout that bag, then we might tie him up (We might tie him up)
Remember we was fucked up, walkin' Sibley, we ain't have enough (We ain't have enough)
We tryna get some cake, these niggas hatin', they was mad at us (They was mad at us)

Yeah, I'm on the pill, cut on Lauryn Hill
On the real, my G-Wag came with six Tonka wheels
Born to kill, B-flag gang, put that on my tears
On my Learjet airplane, tryna pop my ears
Poppin' off'll get you popped for real, you know you not for real
You faker than some shiny white veneers
And if it's smoke, it's just a fire drill
I've been lying still, in the jungle even lions chill
I make a giant kneel
I heard Heaven need some volunteers, that's what I've been hearin'
Hit your momma crib, like your momma feared
From the bottom of my heart, my heart so bottomless, baow
I'll knock your top off, son (Skrrt)
Ready or not (Ready or not), here I come (Feed your soul)
Tunechi
Ayy, I'm just tryna vibe, so I'm rolling up (Ayy, rolling up)
We was living way too fast but we ain't know enough (I ain't know enough)
Might have to get him off the path, if he try to slow me up
And I got this glizzy in this bag, boy, I might blow you up (I might blow you up)
And there's more than fifty when we slide, you know them riders rough (Them riders rough)
If he playin' silly 'bout that bag, then we might tie him up (We might tie him up)
Remember we was fucked up, walkin' Sibley, we ain't have enough (We ain't have enough)
We tryna get some cake, these niggas hatin', they was mad at us (They was mad at us)

I know you mad at me
