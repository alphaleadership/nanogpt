Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard, I heard, I heard about you
Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard it, I heard it

The talk around town is you hang real low
How many inches to the floor?
I really, really, really gotta know
I really, really wanna see the slideshow
Ain't it weird that all the girls is talking 'bout how big it is?
Lemme be the judge of that, see if they got that rhythm pill
Trust me, I ain't scared of it
Boy, trust you should be scared of me
'Cause anything you can do I can do better

Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard, I heard, I heard about you
Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard it, I heard it
Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard, I heard, I heard about you
Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard it, I heard it
You might also like
I heard your girl rest her face up in the hospital
Poor thing didn't hang, it's gon' be a month or two
Now she back in commission, I tell you I'm on a mission
'Cause it's big things I'm after, that little dudes stop it
I wanna see what all the talk's about
I wanna see if you gon' work me out
Rumor has it that you broke the world record
Mastered in the Guinness biggest cock ever

Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard, I heard, I heard about you
Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard it, I heard it
Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard, I heard, I heard about you
Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard it, I heard it

See it for myself, I gotta
See it for myself, I gotta
See it for myself, I gotta
See it for myself, I don't believe you
See it for myself, I gotta
See it for myself, I gotta
See it for myself, I gotta
See it for myself, I don't believe you
See it for myself, I gotta (Okay, Stace)
See it for myself, I gotta (I hear what you poppin')
See it for myself, I gotta (I see you)
See it for myself, I don't believe you
Oh, I pull my thang out
And you can get the pussy poppin'
We can bang out
Yeah, and my clip just hang out
I can turn your pussy into a Reign's house
Now call it The Carter
Tryna put my thang on it, yo, wilder
Come on, shame on you, be taller
You'll be licking my lollipop 'til tomorrow

Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard, I heard, I heard about you
Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard it, I heard it
Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard, I heard, I heard about you
Is it true? Is it true, what they say about you?
I heard it, I heard it

See it for myself, I gotta
See it for myself, I gotta
See it for myself, I gotta
See it for myself, I don't believe you
See it for myself, I gotta
See it for myself, I gotta
See it for myself, I gotta
See it for myself, I don't believe youEmbed
