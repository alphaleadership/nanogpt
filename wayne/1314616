7 ContributorsBlame It (Remix) Lyrics
Excuse me, Remix
I think y'all need to bring a little bit
Of every type of liquor over here to the table, every bottle
We got Weezy, Bus, Pain and Jamie Foxx over here

Blame it on the Goose, got you feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Mami lookin good, mami see me
And now she step into the bar because she know she need me
Her favorite song's on, body so appealing
And she sipping on me because she know she need the feeling
I make her feel good, she call me 'Tron silver
Gotta have me in her body, no matter if it kills her
I get up in her body, I'm kind of like a coach, boo
Mami feeling proper, body's moving like it's supposed to (Love!)
When I'm in it I make mami wanna dance more (Yeah!)
Now she dancing like she's fucking on the dance floor (Yeah!)
She moving like she wanna break 'em off (Uh!)
I keep her hot and sweaty till she wanna take it off (Off)
Baby girl you better sip slow (Yeah)
I'm dangerous when the bottle starts to get low (Yeah!)
When shorty's knocked out from havin a ball
Just blame it on the al-al-al-al-alcohol, yeah!

Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Blame it on who? Blame it on me
She drink till she sleep when she drinkin' on me
I live in the cup, I watch the ice sink
She sippin' all night on some shit that's light pink
You know they say, you are what you drink
But baby I gotta be Louis The Thirteenth
And I could talk to her, but nobody hear
Her liquor so good she don't go around beer
Yeah! And shorty got class
Shorty got class when she pour me in the glass
Hey! Shorty take me to the head
One more shot of me shorty be dead
He heh! And shorty just love drunk
She need a designated driver cause she love drunk
Hi there bartender what's your name?
Let me buy this woman a bottle of Lil' Wayne, yeah
Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol (Uh-huh, T-Pain)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Girl I know you feel good, just like you look
Couple more shots, you open up like a book
I ain't trippin' 'cause I'ma read ya
Shawty, I ain't trippin', I just wanna please ya
I'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty then you know
It's going down, we can go kick it like Judo
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream
So I made her say I, I-I-I
Now she got her hand on my leg, got my seats all wet in my ride
All over my ride
She look me dead in the eye, eye-eye-eye
Then my pants got bigga, she already knew what to figga
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, "Fuck, that nigga"
Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Now to the ballers poppin' bottles with they Henny in they cups
Screamin', "Money ain't a thang", if it ain't, throw it up
In the sky (In the sky)
And hold your drinks up high (High)
And to my independent mamas who can buy they own bottles
If you lookin' like a model, when them broke fellas holla
Tell 'em, "Bye" (Bye)
And hold your drinks up high

Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcoholEmbed
