17 ContributorsBirds Flyinâ€™ High Lyrics
Birds flying high you know how I feel
Birds (birds) flying high, you know how I feel
Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Birds (birds) flying high, birds flying high

Smoking all day drinking on hard liquor
I stay high, even high in this song nigga
Im on silver haze what is you chiefin?
Im in the coupe keeping the rest of the birds sleeping
And I'm high to the tip top
And I'm twisted with a slip knot
Tangled in the grip-lock
And will I ever stop? never that
Light it up bring it back
Bring a ounce not a sack
I got it foggy as a suana in the building
Looking for ur boy, im probably crawling on the ceiling
Fallin on the railing catch me im gone
Im in another zone but trust me im home
Where the blunts be thicker than the arm
And every time Capo roll 'em, he say, "This one is the bomb"
So you know I gotta explode
I dont know where yall at but im in my mode where the...

Keep it coming dont fuck up rotation (naww)
Clean your piss dont fuck up probation (naww)
Shit im glad I ain't got those cases
I can smoke free, my nerves bad, ain't got no patience (naww)
But my birds fly higher your coupe drive by but my coupe drive by ya
Im higher than a kite still lookin for a lighter
Can't get no higher still lookin for a lighter
Big Bob Marley blunts keep a chick in the ride on my side (yea) big ol' donkey butt (yupp)
She talkin to much pass her weed calm the slut
I ain't trynna hear that shit just smoke bitch (smoke)
This is what I call Dyckman's finest sit back baby relax ur tight vagina
Enjoy ur ride enjoy ur high and show some respect when u see the (birds flyin high)
