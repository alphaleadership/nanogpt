Nigga, this shit right here
Nigga, this shit right here
This shit right here (Tsh)
This shit right here

Woah, woah, woah, woah (That shit)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Yup)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Yup)
Woah, woah-woah, woah-woah, woah (Crazy, yup)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Crazy, yup)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Crazy, yup)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Where my dogs? Yup)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Ow)

Nigga, this shit, that Tunechi and that Swizz shit
And it isn't, no Hootie and no fish sticks
Nigga, this shit that Tunechi and that Swizz shit
That boujee and that rich shit, that movie and that script shit
No booty, ain't no bitch shit, shoot and you can hit shit
That shotty is my thotty, that rifle, I'ma wife her
That Uzi is my mistress, you give her a big kiss
Smooches all on his lips, she use his blood for lipstick
Mwah, "You on point, Tune'?" All the time, slime
You got a sharp fuse, bitch, I'm a live wire
I'm tryna talk to 'em, like Paul Finebaum
I bring the chalk to 'em, get that boy outlined
Real chinky like a nigga born in Taiwan
Wrist blingin' like that Drizzy song, "Hotline"
Bloody red, bloody rеd, bloody red, bloody red
Bloody red timеs five like a stop sign, gang
You might also like
Nigga, this shit right here
Nigga, this shit right here
This shit right here
This shit right here

Check, I'm right here, nigga
I'm like Tyson, whisperin' in your right-ear, nigga
I'm takin' off, I need Gucci-fly gear, nigga
Was shootin' at them niggas before Hype Will', nigga
I'm out the holster with the toaster like cheers, nigga
Versace sofa didn't come from IKEA, nigga
I worked the chopper like sheers, nigga
Uncut white girl, call that brick a Britney without spears, nigga
I'm nasty like Nasir, nigga (Nigga)
I raised the blammer like a Grammy, trophy a nigga
Chin-check a nigga, have to goatee a nigga
If he chirpin', flip him like a Nokia, nigga
No Hondas, no Chevys, no Kias, nigga
New bondo, I just put the door key in, nigga
Tell the bottom feeders top chefs feed a nigga
It's lonely at the top and I'm the loneliest nigga, huh

Nigga, this shit right here (Uh, so brazy)
Nigga, this shit right here (Don't let me catch you Uptown)
This shit right here (Don't let me, don't let me catch you)
This shit right here (Uptown, baby)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Uptown brazy)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Uptown, baby, Uptown brazy)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Lay it down, baby, better ante up)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Lay it down, baby, better ante up)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Don't let me, don't let me catch you Uptown)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Don't let me, don't let me catch you Uptown)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Don't let me, ah)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Uptown, baby, Uptown brazy)
Don't let me, don't let me catch you Uptown
Don't let me, don't let me catch you Uptown
If I do, you better ante up
I say "Suu Whoop", you better ante upEmbed
