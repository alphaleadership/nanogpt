17 ContributorsStart This Shit Off Right (Demo)* Lyrics
We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in my house tonight

We got some bad ass bitches, bad ass bitches
Them bitches outside is some sad ass bitches
I know (Leggo, leggo, leggo)
And I know, I know
We got some bad ass bitches, bad ass bitches
Them bitches outside is some sad ass bitches
I know (Leggo, leggo, leggo)
And I know, I know (I know, I know, I know)

Yeah, just a watch and a mink coat (Yeah)
Even my biatch got a mink coat
Yeah, her pink purse match her pink toes
Let them hoes knock, we don't check the peephole
Yeah, just a watch and a mink coat
Say she love me long time like Chinese, ho
Yeah, her pink purse match flamingo
And when the water get too hot, I got a steamboat
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Told my doctor, "Don't prescribe no placebo"
I'm cooking raw, crack house like a Bistro
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Everybody throw a five, Carter Cinco
Thank you, Tune, it's been too dry and not a drink, oh
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Save us from all the monotony, our hero
When I die, please bury me in street clothes
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Slap the piss out a nigga like a P.O
Bad bitches in this bitch, but I ain't seen yours
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh)
Bad bitches in this bitch, but I ain't seen you
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh)
Pretty girl I want my third leg between yours
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh)
Yeah, bad ass dog by the screen door
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh)
And I'm walking 'round the house wearing nothing but a watch and a mink coat
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Yeah, now who gon' tell me something?
Nigga what, nigga huh? She don't tell me, "No"
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Woo, and she let me do whatever
But I just let her know, bitch, you better know
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Yeah, everybody throw a five
Throw a five, Carter Cinco
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) This my last hoorah, so let me hear, "Hooray"
But before I'm finito
