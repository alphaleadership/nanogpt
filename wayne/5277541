3 ContributorsMirror Remix Lyrics
Now, mirror mirror on the wall
No, I know that wasn't my reflection that I just saw
And would you please be so kind to tell me who that is
Because they weren't there when that picture was taken
Pretty sure of that; yep, this another hallucination huh
Same situation, another day, my condition's still unchanged
Have the power to look away
No sense of humor, but why am I laughing maniacally
They must of forged my signature, because that's not my writing
Who brings a bag of stones into a house
Of M I double R O R S someone disastrous
Mirror mirror on the wall, I'm no puppet
So what's with these wires
They don't seem to be coming off, coming off

Mirror on the wall, Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again?

The man that wants to lead an orchestra
Must turn his back to the crowd
While facing another direction continue to smile
It's rigorous, at least more malicious
They say those who matter don't mind
Well, in that case; you probably won't mind if I proceed to veni vici the crowd then
And to have the entire choir sing Carpe Diem
Oh I see them
And I want them able to see me
So analyze my moves as my heart is pulsating
You might also like
Mirror on the wall, Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again?

This is a case of deja vu
No, and that's because my lifestyle's new
A lifestyle that I'm just getting used to
Don't you just despise buying a lego box set
And having a piece missing
Well that's where my life's at
Know that I'm missing something or someone
Not sure how important
But I went  burns to reflect
Stop applying the ointment
Looking now
Looking as I transpire
I wonder what it would be like to have the reflection of a vampire
 x 2
Mirror on the wall, Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we talking to each other again?Embed
