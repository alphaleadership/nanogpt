18 ContributorsBleu Snappin’ Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Huh, huh

Uh, pick 'em off, I fuck 'em all then egg 'em on
Her nipples hard and a nigga cold
Before silicone she was skin and bones
Surfin' that shit like Billabong
Her nigga home, they don't get along
This the only dick she be sittin' on
Bitch ain't gon' be playin' no Game of Thrones
Hold on', hold on', bubble butt with these hands, I caress that
Bust a nut on her ass, call her wetback
Collar tucked, skinny pants, I finesse that
Wings up on the Lamb 'cause it's jet black
Pew, I ain't mad at her
Shе got a man, tell your man you just got manhandled
Pop that cran apple, thе pussy panhandler
I fuck her good, I put her to sleep, I Mr. Sandman her

Mm, dark cider, my nuts make me walk wider
I pull up in a soft top, the car timeless
I'm a sharpshooter, I be with sharpshotters
Money talks, nigga, I got that yada-yada

She say "Get in my belly"
I put dick up in her stomach, she say "Get in my belly"
I put dick up in her stomach, she say "Get in my belly"
She sit on this motherfucker like Corinthian leather
Dick up in her stomach, she say "Get in my belly"
Bought a Birkin for my blicka, she say "Nigga, I'm jelly"
Put some white girl on my thumb, she lick that bitch like a lesbian
Said the truth is hard to swallow, she ain't no lie detector, hold on

Westside, I like my weed like my bitches, from the Westside
I be leanin', I be sippin', I be just fine
Red beam and I ain't talkin' 'bout no X5
Red beam and I ain't talkin' 'bout no X5

Dreads slingin', red flag down my hair tie
Take the kilos out the bag, let 'em air dry
Throw a P up for Pirus, shit that PS5
Throw a P up for Pirus, shit that PS5
I'm a speed up in that new whip, fuck a test drive
I'm a creep up on them niggas like a hairline
Creep up on them niggas like a–
I'ma creep up on them niggas like I'm Left Eye
I'ma squeeze that fuckin' trigger like a necktie
On codeine, I'm like a turtle, I'm a reptile
Red beam and I ain't talkin' 'bout no X5
Red beam and I ain't talkin' 'bout no X5

I'ma speed up in her pussy, fuck her sex drive
I'ma creep up on them niggas like they deaf, slime
I'ma creep up my lil' nigga like a–, like a–
I'ma creep up my lil' nigga like a deadline
Got them sleepin' with the fishes, he was dead-tired
Send a PJ for my bitches, fuck a red eye
Let her pussy open up and I'ma headline
Want a good ting nigga with some money on it
All these karats in my chain make a bunny hop
I be laughin' 'to the bank 'cause it's funny, yup
In the belly of the beast where the stomach at
Hold on, shoot 'em in the–, shoot 'em in the head, that part, nigga, ooh
All these niggas feds and narcs, nigga, ooh
I like my bitches red and dark, nigga, ooh
I like 'em braindead and smart, nigga, ooooooh
Yeah, I'ma shoot em in the head, that part, mm
I think all you niggas feds and narcs, mm
Like my bitches red, red and dark, mm
Mm, dark cider, my nuts make me walk wider
I pull up in a soft top, the car timeless
I'm a sharpshooter, I be with sharpshotters
Money talks, nigga, I got that yada-yada

Ooh, Westside, like my weed like my bitches, from the Westside
I be leanin', I be sippin', I be just fine
Red beam and I ain't talkin' 'bout no X5
Red beam and I ain't talkin' 'bout no X51Embed
