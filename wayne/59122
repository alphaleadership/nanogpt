6 ContributorsI’m Goin’ (Solo) Lyrics
Hello mothafucka, hey, hi, how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby, come to take a shit and urine
On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'

I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

Fuck fucking these bitches
I put on a rubber when I fucking mean business
Punch a king vision
I see straight through 'em
Fuck how I did 'em
Watch how I'm about to do them
I'mma drag him from the river
Dump his body in the lake
Let the bullets from the K throw a party in your face
Yeah, DJ Extra Clip, so go DJ!
I will kill you on your B-Day
Have a bitch with twin Glocks
Jump out your cake
Tell her merc 'em, and don’t forget about the safe
We ain’t even walking, we runnin' this shit
Like a toilet in a bank I want my money and shit
And I call cocaine my Columbian bitch
And my Columbian bitch like my Columbian ditch
Get it? Got it? Good, I'm gone
Boy where you going?
You know where I’m going
You might also like
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

My style, my style, is second to none
So you got to put me on
Like Bonita Applebum
A Tribe Called Quest
A guy called the best
Never lie for less
Cause I stand for more
Young Me
I get it in, yes
I get to the inns like I-N-N
And y'all suite like hotels
And you may be fly but I propel
High Profile, gun no smile
Warn your child, warn your spouse
And I would keep going in but the song's going out
