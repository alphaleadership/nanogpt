3 ContributorsCalling Me Killer Lyrics
Killer, huh?
Callin' Lil Wayne, Wayne a killer
What? What? (Killer)
What? What? (Check)

Hold up, you now under the deep cover of the lil' slugger
Callin' me head busta, run with me K, blocka
Niggas done fled from a, me infrared, sucka
If him wan' play, busta, come make me dead, busta
Beanie' half-way out my nappy head
But I don't care, I just grab my clip, slap and spray
Anywhere, it don't matter where a nigga stay
Just believe me when I say, "Guerrilla warfare"
I swear, it be some more drama about these bags
Niggas in black drive Jags, camouflage rags
Niggas' domes get bust wide open with blood and sweat
Niggas ridin' off in Hummers, laughin', drinkin' Moette
You know me: Corlleon, standin' four feet
I'm totin' cannons, wearin' Rollie's
See, these lil' boys, they ain't really up on my game
But once I run into that nigga playin' with Wayne, man
See, when I spin-a you bend then I be on you block
But when me jump out with the chop-chop, my nigga, you drop
Now where your niggas at, comradie? They not with you now
I guess they heard that when I'm ridin' I make the crew stop
Now, is you 'bout what I'm 'bout?
If you 'bout what I'm 'bout, you 'bout drama
Thuggin' in broad day with four Glocks, a knife, and a chopper
I'm runnin' away, don't get in my way my nigga
Callin' me head busta, caller callin' me killer
You might also like
Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My nigga, when I'm out late call me what you want, full of blunts
Look out your window, see who in the front, me
Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My nigga, when I'm out late call me what you want, full of blunts
Look out your window, see who in the front, check

Now as the heat flame up
Them lookin'-a down the street, them think they see Wayne truck
Him whole block don't scare me cause me get me thing and bust
Them know that Hot Boys known to be dangerous
Now U.P.T. come down, chopper city in the ghetto, my man
Now who that be in the car with the chopper? Oh, it's Lil' Wayne
I get my K, cock, aim, and put holes in your brain
Give me that rag, you ain't no soldier, wipe the blood off my chain
Gettin' blisty, off in a black F-150
'Bout to do the old usual, hit your block, just spittin'
Heads spinnin' like a set of seventeens or somethin'
Respect me for who I be: seventeen head-bustin'
Because them

Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My nigga, when I'm out late call me what you want, full of blunts
Look out your window, see who in the front, me
Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My nigga, when I'm out late call me what you want, full of blunts
Look out your window, see who in the front, check
Original Hot Boy, land-cruisin' with guns
I shall be the one who burn the block up
Never miss when I distribute anger up out my Cali'
Hundred shots automatic, leave ya hopeless in the alley
Now, when a nigga runs up, if the nigga love his life he would have his guns up
Just because of the simple fact that I'm a Hot Boy, and got boys that got toys to stop noise
See, when me ride off in the Hummer, leave him set empty
Now him catch three cause him want beef
Now, me tried to tell the stupid boy, "Don't mess-a with me."
Now look at him, open up his casket and see
Click-clack my mack, twist my Philly cap to the back
Jump in the black and scream, "War", and just, pow-pow
How you love me now? With five barrels to your eye
The scene gets wild, and everybody gon' die
What the dillio? Fill a four-four clip
You'll get flipped for runnin' off at the lip
Who behind the gun flame? Blunt hang, and twisted?
It's Mister Wayne, come splittin' when I spit

Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My nigga, when I'm out late call me what you want, full of blunts
Look out your window, see who in the front, me
Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My nigga, when I'm out late call me what you want, full of blunts
Look out your window, see who in the front, check
Me!
See, them callin' me killer
Huh?
Because them callin' me killer
What?
Them niggas callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
What?
Callin' me killer
(Killer)
Callin' me killer
(Killer)
Them callin' me killer (Killer!)
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga (Killer!)
Killer!
