1 ContributorPlastic Ice Cream Lyrics
What if we could be with somebody else?
Wouldn't you love to stay out too long?
Oh, oh what if we could go there?
What if we could stay a little longer?
What if we could be with somebody else?

Whoa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Where you gonna go?
When you got some ice cream

All of this time, all of this time spent alone
With nothing more than a moment of this wasted time
You walked in, I turned to stare down her perfect face
You wore a dress, so I could have some fun

Whoa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Where you gonna go?
When you got some ice cream
You might also like
Plastic, plastic, plastic, plastic, oh-oh
I've built it up (Built it up up, build it up)
Hell, I'm building up, build it up, build it up (For you)
No, I'm building up, building it up, build it up

All the memories you left where you used to live
All the memories you had in this house, so long ago
And I'll never find out what they are in the past
But you're not really for me
Someday I'll learn to live without you

Whoa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Where you gonna go?
When you got some ice cream

Mula, hey
Shit is fly, throwback, ya heard me?
It's meant for me to survive this gangster shit
I rejected his love grace kindness and mercy
This is not what I would rather be
Maganoo and St. Nick we be talking shit
Y'all think I'm kidding? It's not big thing
But if you love who you are and believe in that
Deja Vu in the booth is the truth when you apply it
And the biggest difference between you and I is...shit
I said that we can kiss the past goodbye but you weren't excited
When defense erupt you can watch as i get feisty
Next time I see it it's going to have a word with me
Bangin in the club and bangin it in your jeep
You got the wrong picture, wrong girl, wrong guy
I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling
Double M no longer that Buick Regal money
Thought it was till I got the Dear John letter
If the court paroal ya then another con enters
Not it's hot on ya block in the hot weather
Thinking about the girl in all leopard
Livin life as a Thug time to face the truth
I blow the guts out the dutch and do the same to you
You know what I came to do change the rules
Just let me know exactly what it is you trying to do
Come see about me if you don't like it
And you better think about it more than special ed
Either way you go through mad mental stress
Got you wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead
Then he walked in threw them both on the table said
It's time to speak the truth maturity
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
Your clothes keep dropping to the ground
I like to clown so pump up the sound
T-t-tell em what it do holla from the bottom yell it from the roof
Somebody put a gun to his head guess what he said to 'em?
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
If you livin by the gun that's the way into debt
A funky message from beginning to end
Been tryna make me do what I used to doEmbed
