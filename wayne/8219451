1 ContributorWe Alright (Remix) Lyrics
When I was broke as a joke
People use to hate on me
Now I'm grown, I don't need your money
Homie imma be ight, be ight, be ight
Homie imma be ight, be ight, be ight
Back in the day shawty wouldn't give me play
Now it's hard for me to keep shawty away
But shawty imma be ight, be ight, be ight
Shawty imma be ight, be ight, be ight

Forever young, no explanation
B**h I do me until I reach my destination
I'm coming up n***a, what's the occupation
I talk to you simple, never lost in translation
No need to wait cuz I will show up late
Sold out seats to hear me articulate
Grеat n***a is fate, I am what I need to be
I do it great, all lеan their seats at me
My mother never imagined
What her words mean to me
If shes down, she call me
She know she can lean on me
Living this life how I dream it to be
Living this life how I dream it to be
How I dream it to be
You might also like
When I was broke as a joke
People use to hate on me
Now I'm grown, I don't need your money
Homie imma be ight, be ight, be ight
Homie imma be ight, be ight, be ight
Back in the day shawty wouldn't give me play
Now it's hard for me to keep shawty away
But shawty imma be ight, be ight, be ight
Shawty imma be ight, be ight, be ight

Young too, no animation
B**h I do me like masturbation
Young money, cash money til I'm k**ed n***a
Bet my funeral be over back when real n***as
Started on the black top with a few pieces of crack rock
Not just as hip-hop and this motherf**ing black rock
Earn my stripes like a motherf**ing black sock
Not as like I need to hit the motherf**ing jackpot
Hurricane Katrina is the motherf**ing back drop
Man you know them n***as got that motherf**er back hot
I'm trying to see how to get that new Barack lect drop
Imma be ight

When I was broke as a joke
People use to hate on me
Now I'm grown, I don't need your money
Homie imma be ight, be ight, be ight
Homie imma be ight, be ight, be ight
Back in the day shawty wouldn't give me play
Now it's hard for me to keep shawty away
But shawty imma be ight, be ight, be ight
Shawty imma be ight, be ight, be ight
Imma be ight
Don't worry about me
This means my n***a does dirt without me
I made my decision, now I'm on a mission
There a lot of kids out there
I want them to listen, cool
As long as my family straight
If they hurting I will k** without the bate
This is a harsh game
N***as throwing dirt on my name
Take what's yours
I hope my kids grow up to think the same
I take the blame, for what went down last night
Don't worry about me
Imma be ight
If I can't catch a break
We be shooting tonight
So relax dawg
I don't want to go back
Don't make me go back

Now I don't know what you heard bout me
From the bottom to the top we going up
Now I don't know what you heard bout me
From the bottom to the top we going up
Now I don't know what you heard bout me
From the bottom to the top we going up
Now I don't know what you heard bout me
From the bottom to the top we going upEmbed
