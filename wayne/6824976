4 ContributorsDo It Without Ya Lyrics
I told my other bitch I'ma get another bitch
I told my main bitch 
Said they want beef, or they want angus
I could come from different angles with black maggies
Got niggas down to ride for me without gas
I shared dark secrets and exposed myself
At least I did it, ain’t nobody else
If you a gangster, you'll walk around saying “I'm a gangster”
You smell the bang, G’s move in silence, like Champagne
Sometimes it gets dark, like a lampshade
And you can skate on the ice like cascade or get paid
Yo' house ain't bigger than my man cave
Whoo
Never afraid, I admit it
I'm lookin' like the landlord, you lookin' like a tenant
Lookin' like I'm payed for, you lookin’ like you rented
Lookin’ like I'm made for it, you lookin’ like you vistin'
It's good to be pimpin'
Embrace all the differences
And I’m gettin' money, I said, “Money” with emphasis

If I had a guitar right now, I'd play that shit
Anytime I cop work, you know I weighed that shit
If I bought a car, cash, I'm sure that you'd ride with me
Soon as you get out, you talk about me in 5 minutes
I'ma do this shit, you lil' bitch you connivin'
Let me hear you say it, you can do it without ‘em
I'ma say it on time, I do it without ya
I'ma say it two times, I do it without ya

If I had a guitar right now, I'd break that shit
Rockstar Tunechi, I might paint my face lil' bitch
Never took the foot off the gas, no breaks and shit
If you in a new car right now, I race that shit
I'ma play the draco like a guitar, smoke fuego and I sip oil
I take her to strip in Vegas and take her to the strip mall
Drugs on the stove, I whip ‘em off into a football
The judge tryna throw the book at me just like a book worm
I'ma pimp and I get at y'all
I sip like I'm from 5th ward
I'm freezing my wrists off
I pay niggas no mind and I got ripped off
I get a few strings, pull ‘em loosely
Got bitches on my back like an acoustic

If I had a guitar right now, I'd play that shit
Anytime I cop work, you know I weighed that shitEmbed
