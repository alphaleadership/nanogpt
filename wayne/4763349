16 ContributorsSorry Lyrics
You feel me?

I get to the money with ease (Ease)
I'm different, they jacking my steez (Swag)
I'm the new wave, it's a breeze (Burr)
Not praying, and she on her knees
I just might go get the 'Rari (Skrrt)
OG game like an Atari
NDA's outside my party (Check)
Humble, but sorry, not sorry (Sorry)

Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (I'm sorry)
Uh, sorry, not sorry (I'm sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (I'm sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry

Pull up on 'em in a Bentley (Bentley)
Hard top for two-fifty (Fifty)
Paid cash, all century
Paperwork with some whiskey (Uh)
I just be handling biz' (I do)
Don't know what a manager is (I don't)
They need to have me on Cribs (They do)
Feel like I abandoned my kid (Kid)
Infinity pool in the back (Back)
Your chick wanna fool with a mack (Mack)
She asking around for my jack (Jack)
But she only one in the pack (Uh)
I fly on the jet to relax (Relax)
Shrimp and champagne for the snack (The snack)
Suckers wan' hit me with a dap (Dap)
Fifty-fifty, get the strap (Baow)

I get to the money with ease (Ease)
I'm different, they jacking my steez (Swag)
I'm the new wave, it's a breeze (Burr)
Not praying, and she on her knees
I just might go get the 'Rari (Skrrt)
OG game like an Atari
NDA's outside my party (Check)
Humble, but sorry, not sorry (Sorry)

Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)

And I'm not sorry for all this Bvlgari
I'm not sorry for all of these foreigns
I'm not sorry for y'all being worried
I'm not sorry for y'all being sorry
No apologies, no apologize
Sorry, I'm not sorry, why you texting me S-R-O-Y?
I just can't feel sorry for you niggas
No I'm sorry, slime
Her face full of sorrow, fuck 'til I see tears of joy, she cry
Ooh, yeah, and I am not sorry for all of these charges
I am not sorry for all of these lawyers
I am not sorry, but y'all gon' be sorry, yeah
And we are not sorry, nigga, we are soaring, yeah, yeah
And I am not sorry at all (Mula)
I get to the money with ease (Ease)
I'm different, they jacking my steez (Swag)

Not praying, and she on her knees
I just might go get the 'Rari (Skrrt)
