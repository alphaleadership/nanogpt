22 ContributorsJust Right for Me Lyrics
Uh, she so good for me
Mr. good stuff, Mrs. good stuffin', good lovin'
Watch me pull up 'til I pull somethin' on a full stomach
Take her out to eat like, "I'm hungry if you're hungry"
Hoppin' it off, then droppin' her off
Then toppin' it off with a muah on her jaw
And a smack on the ass, and a call me tomorrow
And a walk to the door and a honk on the horn
Got Monica on my playlist and she on my bae list
But since I got a situation, I use imagination, alright

Baby, baby, baby, baby (Tunechi)
Can't no one come take me from my baby (One, two, three, four)
Like I can give my heart and all my time (Alright)
Gotta keep my lovin' on your mind (Yeah)

Oh, you got me goin' (Woo, I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin')
So far and deep (I'm deep, I'm deep, I'm deep)
I can't control it (No, I can't control it, control it, control it, control it)
Meant to be together through the times

'Cause you're just right for me (Baby, I)
Boy, you know your love's the best
And it's just right for me (Baby, I am sure)
And I don't care about your past
'Cause you're just right for me (Baby, I-I-I)
Just right for me, me-me, me (Baby, I know it)
And I don't care about your past, hey
See Monica LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
Baby, baby, baby, baby
It's like you're always tryna keep me happy
So you know what a wife like me gon' do
Got me thankin' on the two that made you (Thank you, baby)

Oh, you got me goin' (Woo, uh) so far and deep (So far, so deep)
I can't control it (I can't control it, no)
Meant to be together through the times (Meant to be, ayy)

'Cause you're just right for me (Baby, you know)
Boy, you know your love's the best (The best, yeah)
And it's just right for me (Baby, I will show you)
And I don't care about your past
'Cause you're just right for me

You know it, uh, uh
Oh, oh, you got my attention
Boy, you never lose 'cause you know I miss it (You know)
The things we do, my king, you're my best friend

And it's just right for me (For me)
And I don't care about your past
'Cause you're just right for me (Just right for me)
Baby, I will show you (Uh-huh, just right for me)
Just right for me
Just right, my time
The only one in my life (Ohh, oh-oh)
Baby, and you know it
Ooh, youâ€™re just right for me (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
Just right for me, oh12Embed
