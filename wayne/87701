6 ContributorsNo Problems Lyrics
Little nigga in a 2-Door six
Show my ass as you can see, no shit
I'm talking straight off the showroom shit
When you're talking about weight, I'm the nigga they get
By the way, I'm in a six with your chick
45 on my hip, don't trip or hear this
I'm talking point-blank bitch
First you had it on your mind, now you can't think shit
Yeah Lucci crazy
Fall up in the spot, all Gucci baby
Quick to do your lady
Send her on a date, when she's through she pay me
Now that's pimpin' dog
Quick to slap a hoe if she piss me off
Then it's back to the kitchen bakin' biscuits foe
Wrap them hoes up then I ship them off

Well a little bit of money never hurt nobody
But if you're trying to take mine, I'ma hurt somebody
And I'ma pile it up til I'm dead and gone
We don't want no problems
Boy you don't want no problems

Uh, talk that shit, get your shit fucked up
Got a bitch who chop dicks and a bitch who cuts nuts
Which one of these hoes you want? Pimp
Call my nigga Fee, say he in for the night
Saw a nigga I was beefin' with at a red light
On his forehead was a little red light
Put his ass to sleep, don't let the bed bugs bite
I'm telling you dog, AK-47 and all
Big nuts bitch, medicine balls
I'm high as shit, I see heaven and all
And I ain't lying, I'm flying, pelican y'all
But don't fuck with me, stay celibate dawg
Picture this shit: The bitch who you with wanna hop on my dick
And never get off, never get off
I mean- I mean even when I tell her "Get off"
Ol' fruity ass nigga
One head shot, watch your watermelon come off
Aaaagh
Young Mula baby!
Hey Flow, let's race our Bugatti's
You might also like
Well a little bit of money never hurt nobody
But if you're trying to take mine, I'ma hurt somebody
And I'ma pile it up til I'm dead and gone
We don't want no problems
Boy you don't want no problems

Hey, now when the hell's money been a problem? I can't tell
Lord knows I ain't never seen a rich man mad as hell
That's why I'm working all night long til I make my bail
And I've been on my mail, goddammit

Well a little bit of money never hurt nobody
But if you're trying to take mine, I'ma hurt somebody
And I'ma pile it up til I'm dead and gone
We don't want no problems
Boy you don't want no problems
Well a little bit of money never hurt nobody
But if you're trying to take mine, I'ma hurt somebody
And I'ma pile it up til I'm dead and gone
We don't want no problems
Boy you don't want no problems2Embed
