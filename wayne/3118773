29 ContributorsNew Level Lyrics
My bed, my bed
Somebody's takin' my place (Right Now)
Yeah, yeah, baby
Hitmaka

Tryna put you on that level, another level
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh yeah)
You know you could do much better (Do)
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh, oh)

You've been so incomplete
You've been fell in too deep
Wish I could read your mind
And stop wasting my time

Tryna put you on that level, another level
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh yeah)
You know you could do much better (Do)
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh, oh)
Tryna put you on that level (Another level)
Tryna put you on that level (Oh yeah)
You know you could do much better (Oh, oh)
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh, oh)

Ice up on the check the bezel
Yeah, rocky, rocky, fruity pebble
Do you realize this is what you've got?
Don't tell me you second guessin' now

You've been so incomplete
You've been fell in too deep (Too deep)
Wish I could read your mind (Read your mind)
And stop wasting my time

Tryna put you on that level, another level (On that level)
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh yeah)
You know you could do much better  (Do, oh)
I'm tryna put you on that level (On that level, oh, oh, on that)
Tryna put you on that level, another level (On, on that)
Tryna put you on that level (Oh, oh yeah)
You know you could do much better (Do, oh)
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh, oh)4Embed
