3 ContributorsAll My Life (In the Ghetto)  Lyrics
I was on the block right, wasn't in my right mind
Just a young nigga hustling, tryna get mines
Movin' with the 9 double M
Niggas like, "You don't really wanna fuck with him"
Yeah, young teenager, infatuated with paper
Yeah I had to get it cause momma, she wasn't able
Black and white TV set, no cable
40's in the fridge, chicken noodles on the table
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
Child of the ghetto, raised off a different tune
Watching Bob Barker in my living room
If your price was right, I could get you a whole living room
Yeah, them was my gutter ways
Back in the gutter days, no education but thе gutter pays
Through it all, I came a long way
From selling thе yay, fistfights to gunplay

Sittin' on the block and I'm doin' bad
Dreaming about the things that I never had
Got me thinking to myself "I gotta get it man"
You can play if you want, I'm gon' get it man
I say, all my life I've known
One day eventually I'll blow
You might also like
Yeah, times is hard as it is
That's why I got guns and my guns got kids
That's why I be going so tough on them hoes
I play my own hand, I don't shuffle or fold
Fuck with a nigga, let's go fuck with some hoes
Hear them bitches screaming like they stuck in a hole
I am not a demon but was once a lost soul
'Til I found myself a block away from the crossroad
I have, outgrown the fishbowl
And now I'm on my feet like a fucking insole
And yeah it may hurt like a fucking lymph node
But it's fuck the world like a fucking nympho
And we spend dough 'cause we make more
And I make sure when I say so
It's Jay Rock and Weezy, need I say more?
Clothesline the beat, Ted DiBiase flow, yeah

Sittin' on the block and I'm doin' bad
Dreaming about the things that I never had
Got me thinking to myself "I gotta get it man"
You can play if you want, I'm gon' get it man
I say, all my life I've known
One day eventually I'll blow
Jay Rock still that same OG
I ain't tryna see the grave or the penitentiary
Everyday living, tryna stay on my feet
Even though a nigga paid but my heart in the streets
See my dogs, I'm a beast, so hard on these beats
So my family can eat, I'll be damned if I see no income
Here come Jay Rock, they know
Crack music, drug kingpin flow, oh

Kingpin ho (Yeah) need I say more? (Yeah)
Your family could die, when I say go (Go)
Green light, green light, what ya green like?
Before ya sign me up, get the scene right
And I just hop in the phantom when I'm feelin' nice
Cause driving slow in the Lam', it doesn't seem right
Yeah, and I remember them long nights
Living the wrong life but I made that wrong right, Weezy

All the struggling
All it does is keep me hustling
Oh my, my

Sittin' on the block and I'm doin' bad
Dreaming about the things that I never had
Got me thinking to myself "I gotta get it man"
You can play if you want, I'm gon' get it man
I say, all my life I've known
One day eventually I'll blowEmbed
