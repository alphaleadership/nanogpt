3 ContributorsLollipop Lyrics
Oww!
Young Mula
I said, "He's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper"
So I let her lick the rapper

She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick like a lollipop
She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick like a lollipop
She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick like a lollipop
So I let her lick the rapper
She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick like a lollipop
She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick like a lollipop
She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick like a lollipop
So I let her lick the rapper

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps
Shawty wanna thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

Okay, lil' mama had a swag like mine
She even wеar her hair down her back like minе
I make her feel right when she wrong, like lying
Man, she ain't never had a love like mine
But man, I ain't never seen a ass like hers
That pussy in my mouth, had me lost for words
I told her back it up like, "urp— urp—"
I made that ass jump like, "jermp— jermp—"
That's when she

She wanna lick me like a lollipop
She wanna lick me like a lollipop
She wanna lick me like a lollipop
So I let her lick the rapper

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps
Shawty wanna thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps
So I let her lick the rapper
She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick like a lollipop
She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick like a lollipop
She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick like a lollipop
So I let her lick the rapper
She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick like a lollipop
She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick like a lollipop
She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick like a lollipop
So I let her lick the rapper

So I let her lick the rapper2Embed
