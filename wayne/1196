17 ContributorsI Need A Hot Girl Lyrics
You need a hot one I got one, now take it and bend
Shake it down, break it down with me and a friend
Biggity-bounce, slide, ride, work that cat to the right
Push it down, push it up, psst, boom, you dynamite
Lick it up like ice cream, nigga, you knowin'
You make me ba, ba-ba, ba, ba, Rocky Balboa
See, I'm loving when we thuggin', baby, just don't stop
You could wobble-dy, wobble-dy, drop, drop it like it's hot
Beat it up and eat it up, love, that's your dick
And if you ain't from the ghetto, then ride out, bitch
Arms, legs, backs, and breast
You better read her fucking tats, nigga, Mannie Fresh
Suck it up and yuck it up, baby, work on that pole
Got them niggas in a circle hollering, "Here we go, oh"
Back that ass up, lil' one, all the way to the zipper
I really like you, hot girl, but I got to flip ya

Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl
Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl

What? Huh? What?
Huh? Do your thing, girl
Do your thing, bitch, do your thing, bitch
Do your thing, bitch, do your thing, bitch

I need a hot and spicy ho I can shop with
Give my ho ten Gs, told her spend the shit
See, my hot girl ride Lexus Coupe, bitch
And she got the matchin' Rollie, ho, floss your shit
And she got the matching mink for the winter, bitch
Plus, see, a real hot girl can't be faded, bitch
Roll the dice, hit the sev', no craps, bitch
She got the brand new Rover out the showroom quick
Customized TVs all through that shit
Yokahama twenty-inch dubs on that bitch
Now see my Cash Money hot girl floss her shit
Ridin' uptown, bumping Hot Boys, ya bitch
And that blue-faced Rolex, I bought that bitch
Keep big head Benjamins all through her shit
Fuck a thug girl, them hoes can only suck my dick
I need a hot girl to represent this uptown shit

Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl
Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl
Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl
Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl
What? Hot girl
What? Hot girl
What? Hot girl
Where my bitch at? Look

A hot girl is a solid ho
If a bitch get outta line, she a violent ho
Ain't no pest, far from being a whining ho
Fuck up, she confess, she ain't no lying ho, that's what I need
A hot girl is a jazzy bitch
I'd take her any day for a classy bitch
On the down low for her nigga, she a nasty bitch
I tell her touch it, she gonna reach out and grab the dick
I bust a nut, it's soft, she get it back hard
The police kick in the door, she take the charge
If a nigga go to jail, she run for her nigga
Money orders, business, and pump one for her nigga
She be a nigga balling, work that body for her nigga
Let me come through, hit the stash, and rock-a-bye the nigga
I can't see no other bitch for the B.G.Â 
But a hot girl for sure, call her a H.G., a hot girl

Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl
Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl
Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl
Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl
I like 'em hot, the ones that don't tell me to stop
Eat dick, swallow the cum and they know how to pop
I need a project bitch, a hoodrat bitch
One that don't give a fuck and say she took that dick
She a doggy with it, she can wobble-dy dance
She know how to monkey with it
Open her legs and squeeze a nigga like she want me in it
Now turn around and back it up
Then throw it at a nigga 'til I say, "Ooh, that's enough"
Give me a gangsta ho, one that don't give a fuck
And that'll shank a ho
One that'll slang still, and keep it on the low
One that'll do time for me and slang that fuckin' coke
Dawg, you know
A lil' shorty get in the twat, have it hurting and thumping
They be like, "They say he small, girl, he workin' with something"
I'm Lil' Wayne, on fire, I'll snatch your lil' boo
You a hot girl, baby, what's happening with you?

Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl
Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl
Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl
Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl
Oh, what you want boy? I want a hot girl

You understand? Look
That's the motherfuckin' hot boys
Definition of a motherfuckin' hot girl
You dig what I'm sayin'? It's all gravy
If you fit the description, then come on, get with a nigga
Come on, get with a nigga
If you fit the standard, come on, get with a nigga7Embed
