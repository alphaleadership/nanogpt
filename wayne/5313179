15 ContributorsKings & Queens Lyrics
Gotta chase that money
Gotta chase that green
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens
And we gon' be rich forever (Yah)
We gon' be rich forever (Mula)
Gotta chase that money (Yah)
Gotta chase that green (Yeah)
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens (Uh, yeah)
And we gon' be rich forever (Mula, baby)
We gon' be rich forever (Yeah, Mula, bae)

Rich forever, sitting on leather
If you hating god bless you like you sniffed some pepper
I'm on an island where it's quiet and the fish is speckled
With a bitch I call JJ for jiggling Jello
Lord rich forever, kiss the bezel
Rubies in the watch face, it came with the freckles
Got a black card to pay for all the incidentals
And my house so big I hear my whispers echo
Lord rich forever, forever and a day
Trying not to confuse the gas pedal with the brake
I just made a multi-million dollar settlement today
I'm talking shit, you can't imagine all the peppermints I ate
A couple hundred thousand here, it keep the federal away
A couple hundred thousand there and now I'm settling a case
Walked straight up out the Rikers like I never spent a day
And the money like pussy, it's better when you chase, lord
You might also like
Gotta chase that money (Yeah)
Gotta chase that green (Woo)
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens (Amen, yeah)
And we gon' be rich forever (Mula, baby, ah)
We gon' be rich forever (Yeah, Mula, baby)
Gotta chase that money (Yeah)
Gotta chase that green ()
We are coming for the crowns (Yeah)
We are kings and queens (Can't stop money, nigga, no you can't)
And we gon' be rich forever (I-I woke up this morning and I looked in the mirror and I told myself, I said Tunechi)
We gon' be rich forever (Mula, baby)

Rich forever, lit forever
I'm higher than pitch and treble
I just sip and I twist them pedals
My bitch is special
I stay busy, she be salty like a twisted pretzel
Lord busy schedule, misfit rebel
When the money come, the bitch sing Christmas carols
Pistol several, rich but careful
Still wondering when they gon' make a triple barrel
Got money on my mind and I don't see a limit
Tell my girl I'm coming right now, I'ma be a minute
She said "The money more important" and now she offended
I say "You damn right," she say "Stop agreeing with me"
Niggas copy me and mimic, they just comedy and gimmicks
Put your money where your mouth is, I'ma be the dentist
I swear I'ma get the money constantly consistent
I'll be rich forever, I'ma be a minute, yeah
No more late notices for the electric bill
No more heat knock up on your doors and we can barely get our fill
No more scraping by
No more living just to die

Gotta chase that money (I'm a chase it)
Gotta chase that green (I'm chasing, I'm chasing)
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens (And I won't be complacent)
And we gon' be rich forever (Mula, baby)
We gon' be rich forever (Young Mula, baby)
Gotta chase that money (I'm chasing)
Gotta chase that green (I'm chasing, I'm chasing)
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens (Amen, Amen)
And we gon' be rich forever (I told her don't worry, because)
We gon' be rich forever (Amen, Amen)4Embed
