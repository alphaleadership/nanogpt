16 ContributorsShe Will (Remix) Lyrics
I mean forgive me for being so straightforward
But it’s been quite a minute since I’ve been here
And umm, I mean if you will
Just take a second to look around man
You know what I’m saying
Its a bunch of square ass niggas in here
And I know you don’t do this often but I’m the exception
Do it for me huh, pop that pussy for a real nigga ma Lets go

Say bruh, I’m so official outta sight
What’s about me not to like
I put that pipe inside her
Like my diamonds are her guiding light
I’m dynamite, K-I-N-G, P-I-M-P, admire me
A plethora of fine freaks trailing right behind me
Killin shit dead, turn the club to a crime scene
Pocket full of money like I run a crime ring
Million dollar chain, everything shining
It’s safe to say I do my thing honey, nah mean?
Bunch of young hoes know Chinese
In bed stuck together like they siamese
I run in rod way to feel her, she say “Gah-lee”
I say I’m tryna touch her heart, close ya eyes, breathe
Now she running from me, but she ain't tryna leave
I keep a quarter key of pussy thats a nine piece
Legs open curtain closed, rock solid hurting hoes
Buss it open, sure she will, who else is there to do it fo'
Fo’sho
See T.I. LiveGet tickets as low as $112You might also like
She just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and tell me “baby, its real”
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit than again maybe she will
Yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will

Yeah, I tell her “now go on, pop that pussy for me”
Haters can’t see me, but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I’m all about “I” give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that “wine and dine”
Try to check me and I’mma have ‘em checkin’ pulses
They say chose wisely, thats why I was chosen
Rocking like asphalt, its the cash fault
Looked in the face of death and took it’s mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face South and her ass North
But I’m Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!
She just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and tell me “baby, its real”
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit than again maybe she will
Yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
She just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and tell me “baby, its real”
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit than again maybe she will
Yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will2Embed
