Never
Never

I been lying here, staring at the wall
Since I met you I’ve been so messed up, it’s critical
I want your everything, but you ain’t giving back
It’s getting deep now, it’s getting deep now

I was crazy, so, so naive too
You mean everything to me, but I mean nothing to you

Never should’ve said hello
Never should’ve let my eyes turn back
I was happy on my own
I never should’ve said, said, said hello, hello

Uh, smoking on some grass
Got me thinking ’bout yo’ ass
Can’t believe it didn’t last
Ride or die, I guess we crashed
Left me hanging and now I’m drinking
And I don’t drink, but I’m no saint
Broke my heart like I break the bank
Damn, gotta watch my love boat sinkk
What? You think your shit don’t stank?
Fucking with you, now I gotta see a shrink
I think about you more than I blink
And we were so right, write like ink
I think you want me like I want you…
Overall, like a jumpsuit
You can count on me like 1, 2
But you dropped me like a sunroof
Fuck’s up with that?
I want yo’ ass back
So won’t you pass back
And throw that ass back
Damn, and we don’t even speak no mo’
But you had me at hello
You might also like
Never should’ve said hello
Never should’ve let my eyes turn back
I was happy on my own
I never should’ve said, said, said hello, hello

I been lying here, staring at the wall
Since I met you I’ve been so messed up, it’s cri-cri-cri-cri-critical
I want your everything, but you ain’t giving back
It’s getting deep now (Deep now)

Never should’ve said hello
Never should’ve let my eyes turn back
I was happy on my own
I never should’ve said, said, said hello, hello
Young Mula baby
Never should’ve said hello
Never should’ve let my eyes turn back
I was happy on my own
I never should’ve said, said, said hello, helloEmbed
