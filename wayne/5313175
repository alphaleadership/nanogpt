Wait a minute, ain't my business where she going
Wait a minute, I just want some before she go and
Wait why you in your feelings when I wanna feel something?
Why you in your purse when I'm tryin' to tell you something?
Why you on your phone after 2 in the morning?
Who the fuck you talking to at 2 in the morning, girl?
That's why I'm with my side bitch baby
'Cause I ain't got time for your main tricks
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
And if the side bitch start acting crazy
I'mma run to the next side bitch
Bitch don't chase me, chase me

And you know what is right, so come over tonight
Don't want fuss and fight, let's get right
Right now a nigga feeling so nice
And I feel like I owe you something
Let me show you something, girl
