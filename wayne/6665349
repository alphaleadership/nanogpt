Turn your wife to a groupie (Yeah)
He got smoked like a loosie (Yeah)
Ride the Wraith like a hooptie (Yeah)
I've been feelin' like, I've been feelin' like Tunechi
Coming live from the 5-0-4
Bad bitch in my mansion with a mil' on the floor
Big Tunechi, I can't ride them lil' Masis no more
Young nigga still grindin', I'm the muh'fuckin' G.O.A.T
I been feelin' like Tunechi, huh, I been feelin' like, yeah, fuck 'em
Let me get in my bag, duffle, eat that bitch like the Last Supper
Got her feelin' like, ooh, Tunechi, got me feeling like, yeah, fuck 'em
Got me feelin' like Rich The Kid, with grown-ass man money

I took the top off the 'cLaren, I'm letting the guts show
Walk in my bathroom, I step in the drug store
Treat the two-hundred foot yacht like a tug boat
Who want smoke?
Yeah, 'cause the bullet be drippin' like snot from a snub nose
I'm aimin' right for your heart like a love note
I told you right from the start, from the front door
I tote a rifle, a pump, it’s a gun show
It's me and Lil Richie and a fleet of some bitches
We stick to the code like Leo da Vinci
Many men, they wishing death upon me
Bop, bop, bop, give 'em three wishes
I need me a bitch that be needing them bitches
Fresh plate of pussy, I ain’t cleaning the dishes
Chef's play the bosom, yeah, I skeet on them titties
Creamy delicious, more babies than a pediatrician
Court days, I be leaning, I miss 'em
Nigga trippin', put the beef in the skillet
I pistol whip him, I got teeth on the glizzy
Like no way, can't believe it, I'm serious
No way, can't believe what I'm feelin'
Don’t play, they don’t need to play with me
OJ on this beat like it fit me

Weezy F., bitch, don’t forget the baby

And I’m still screaming “Fuck you, pay me!”
I been feeling like Tunechi, bought the Maybach Mercedes
I’m in the Trukfit
I might fuck on a bitch and I make her lit
Man, I feel like Tha Carter, really rich
Keep it real, 100, I can never switch
You just a worker, the boss in this bitch
I go platinum just talkin' my shit
My bitch too bad, get a bag if she throw a fit (Bag)
I’m the G.O.A.T. killer, rappers get their throat slit
Count another fifty mil' like "Oh shit!"
Bank account gettin' heavy like a gold brick
I might buy a Bugatti
