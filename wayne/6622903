4 ContributorsRUN Lyrics
'Ayo Pitt We Got One?'
'Call Pitt If You Need a Hit'

Shit
One for the hurt, Run for the hill
But one from the hammer a get a nigga killed
Fill a nigga up, dinner is for real
We gon hit a nigga up, and split a nigga meal

He gon snatch, what chain, off who? (Not me)
Ion think a nigga wanna make the news (TV)
You can't try me like a goof I keep a tool (Blicky)
Ima rockstar and I dropped outta school (bitch please)
Ima young nigga, I ain't got sense but I ain't dumb nigga
I just gotta keep a blick you betta not run
If you do you betta not slip whoever run wit em
We them niggas that they fearin

First things first, Im from the east side of Tampa
I felt my share of pain, it was hard for me to handle
Put my nigga in thе dirt, it was a very hard decembеr
And he was dissin on my brother now his mama lightin candles
You might also likeGo lights camera action, bero bullets my new fashion
If we hanging out that window me and bro gon make it happen
Off this perc Im kinda aggravated, I just get to clappin
But my lil nigga he be tweakin, ain't got sense he get to blastin

One for the hurt, Run for the hill
But one from the hammer a get a nigga killed
Fill a nigga up, dinner is for real
We gon hit a nigga up, and split a nigga meal

He gon snatch, what chain, off who? (Not me)
Ion think a nigga wanna make the news (TV)
You can't try me like a goof I keep a tool (Blicky)
Ima rockstar and I dropped outta school (bitch please)
Ima young nigga, I ain't got sense but I ain't dumb nigga
I just gotta keep a blick you betta not run nigga
If you do you betta not slip whoever run wit em
We them niggas that they fearin

Yeah, if niggas actin how they feel
Then I pull it out the jacket get to clappin like a seal, yeah
Kidnappin the lil ones, throwin bitch niggas off the back of the building
I hope you know how to fly, and sincerely
I would do the same thing to everyone you live with
Everything you stand for send it to the heaven sky
Weezy F baby boy, get it right everytime

Shit
One for the hurt, Run for the hill
But one from the hammer a get a nigga killed
Fill a nigga up, dinner is for real
We gon hit a nigga up, and split a nigga meal

He gon snatch, what chain, off who? (Not me)
Ion think a nigga wanna make the news (TV)
You can't try me like a goof I keep a tool (Blicky)
Ima rockstar and I dropped outta school (bitch please)
Ima young nigga, I ain't got sense but I ain't dumb nigga
I just gotta keep a blick you betta not run nigga
If you do you betta not slip whoever run wit em
We them niggas that they fearin
