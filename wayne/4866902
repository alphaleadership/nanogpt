6 ContributorsFamous (Demo) Lyrics
Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky
Yeah, you must be famous
This is how you live your life
Different city every night
Yeah, you must be famous, famous

I'ma get on the TV, mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say, "Oh my God"
They got a point
I take security everywhere, I be so paranoid
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Lord knows that's the truth
So with that said
Rest in peace to every dead
Military troops
Shootouts versus photoshoots
I've been through both, I'm photogenic
I'm bulletproof, almost saw the finish line
Plenty times, rock and roll, live or die
Gettin' high as hell, they say time will tell
Well, I tell time to hush
I tell 'em to kiss my ass
They say, "Can you look this way? Can you look this way?"
Pictures flash, I must be famous
You might also like
Welcome to your name in lights (Woo)
All the lighters in the sky (I must be famous)
Yeah, you must be famous (Yeah, I'ma get on the TV momma)
This is how you live your life (Yeah)
Different city every night (I must be famous)
Yeah, you must be famous, famous, uh

Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
It's you and your lawyer, everybody else is a plaintiff
You know entertainment, sex, drugs and entertainment
You know miscellaneous, sex, drugs simultaneous
Party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twist the light bulb if it's blinking
You're never alone
And I don't motherfuckin' blame you
Can't talk to yourself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen ya since the grass been greener
And your friends say you changed and they can't hear you jingle
You want Tina and Nancy, you get Nancy and Tina
Never question yourself, unless you ask, "Am I dreamin'?"
Fan mail and subpoenas, shake ya hand they don't clean 'em
Never forget they seen ya
You gas 'em up with that premium
And they say, "Look this way, look this way"
Pictures flash when they see ya
To put 'em in magazines
Then after that, the museum
You must be famous
Welcome to your name in lights (Yeah)
All the lighters in the sky (You must be famous)
Yeah, you must be famous (I'ma get on the TV, mama)
This is how you live your life
Different city every night (I must be famous)
Yeah, you must be famous (Huh), famous

They gon' pray that your career, be short and sweet
But they wish they were in your shoes, take them off, walk on a beach
Superstars don't twinkle and we don't sleep
And you can't spell fame, without me
May your Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
"Thank God, fuck fame, fuck the police"
'Cause superstars don't twinkle, superstars beam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
Oh my God, I must be famous

Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky
Yeah, you must be famous (Oh my God, I must be famous, yeah)
This is how you live your life (Yeah)
Different city every night (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous (Yeah, I'ma get on the TV, mama), famous
Kiss my motherfuckin' ass2Embed
