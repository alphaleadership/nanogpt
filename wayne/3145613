L.A.T, go

Okay, I'm shinin', beamin', glossin', big timin', stuntin' and flossin' (Yeah)
Dangerous, approach with caution, if I sneeze, you in a coffin (Blatt)
Chasin' paper, we do that often, two bad bitches, thick like horses (Yeah)
Let 'em snort cocaine at a party, leave 'em stiff like rigor mortis (Woo)
Don't try to race, this car got horses, the pint we drink, it costs a mortgage (Yeah)
Flow so dope, man, you can't copy, you can't bite it, you can't forge it
I got bars, with more in storage, watch me blossom, watch me flourish
If you try to touch my porridge, you will feel my chucks like Norris
All my bitches think I'm gorgeous, get a massage while I'm recordin'
Single like a dollar bill, I am a free man, call me Morgan
Come and slob on my knob (Knob), like corn on the cob (Yeah)
Check in with me (Yeah), and go and do your job (Hey)
Now lay in the bed (Yeah), and then give me head (Hey)
I don't have to ask (No), I don't have to beg (Woo)
Yeah, I'm bumpin' Three 6 Mafia in the Phantom of the Opera
Choppers from Yugoslavia, bake niggas like tilapia (Dah, dah)
L.A.T., Young Money mafia, try but it ain't no stoppin' us
Why? We back by popular demand, quit baller-blockin' us (Yeah)
Lord Gudda, praise a nigga, M.O.B., I'm brazy, nigga
Hard at work, I'm slavin', nigga, yeah, surf's up, I'm wavy, nigga
Percocet and Adderall, man, I could walk on water (Walk on water)
I got a son, his name Jaylen, and he want all your daughters (He want all your daughters)
I'm a landmine, got this by a landslide, I'm racin', nigga
Cruise control, I'm pacin', nigga, turn around, I'm wavin', nigga, Gudda

There's a Glock clocked by my pants line (Yeah)
Young dreadhead, throwing gang signs (What else?)
I got bands like it's band time
Posted up at granny house, trappin' off the landline
What's all that hootin' and hollerin'? I'm who bring the dollars in
Drop the top, it was botherin', now go let your mother in
The cocaine from Colombia, the chopper is sovereign
Got a house full of bricks, you can call it remodelin'
Bitch, grow up, it's only head if you swallowin'
Baby, get to geekin', get to geekin' and gobblin'
Your friends think I'm bad, they must be lookin' for trouble then
It's a foam party, I be bustin' they bubbles then
Then I hop in the whip, make a play on some bricks
My homies say, "Pull up", we just came up on a lick
I'm in the ends with the sticks, it's the revenge of the Crips
Ho, you know it's O.H.B., I brought the gang in this bitch

Ho, you know it's L.A.T., we almost famous, lil' bitch
On our toes and on our feet like Usher Raymond, lil' bitch
And you know Lil Wayne is the shit and you strainin' to shit
Fat head, long neck, she 'bout to strangle this dick
I got more bang-bang in a stick than butane in a bic
I got my whole gang-gang in this bitch and you came with a bitch
I got more purple rain than Prince and more cocaine than Mitch
I got more shit than piss, it make more money than sense
She got more hips than tits, she got more tricks than tips
She put my name on her tongue and then she licks her lips
L.W., Lil Wayne, to them, to her, that's length and width
Kill you for me, she will like Jada Pinkett Smith
It's the return of the Blood, 'bout to turn up and thug
We won't know who got the chicken, show the colonel the gun
Me and my dirty-ass stripper take a bath in 1s
Make her milk these fuckin' niggas like some Cap'n Crunch
Motherfuckers try to test me, I ain't cram for one
All these fuckin' karats on me, bitch, I'm Rabbit's son
Happy birthday, I already got the gift of gab at one
Motherfuckers run they mouth until they cramp they tongue
Play pussy, get fucked, play ass, get stuck
Playtime is over, that ass is grass and now that grass get cut
Duct tape and we quackin' up, then beat 'em with more bats
Than a vampires and Draculas, ashes to ashes to dust
Buried just for starin', yellow tape like canaries
We all bite and no talk, my sharks breakin' your aquarium
Out of the ordinaries and went to the art of hustlin'
When you see them thieves comin', know that loyalty's amongst them, L.A.T2Embed
