I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy

I mean, you know
It's like when I feel really crazy
I just get my broom and fly away
I go real, real far away
Young Money
That’s-that's-that's just what we do
You know, I mean we-we wear straightjackets
And we-we-we-we stay in, you know, padded rooms
And, you know, and we fly away

Ayo, I mean, I’m brand new, and I can't stand you
I show these bitches how to do it like a manual
I got Nathaniel and my nigga Daniel
My bodyguards will be quick to pull a hand out
I need a man, though, laid, eating mangoes
I keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
I got some bangles all over my ankles
I'm such a star, they singing thе "Star Spangled
Banner," I am the rap Hannah
Mo-Mon-Montana, so fix your antеnna
I keep three hoes, but don't call me Santa
A-And I'm, and I'm flyer than reindeers in the winter
You might also like
I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy

Ayo, ayo, I mean, I'm real fresh, did the dope girl fresh
I'm V.I.P., they be stunting in the coat check
I mean, I’m hella fly, I ain’t got a alibi
Yo bartender, keep on bringing out the “Malibi”
I mean Malibu, can I get a salad too?
Yo, why you looking at me like you got a attitude?
And why you got them toes hanging out your Prada shoes?
Your Fred Flintstone feet, yabba-dabba-doo
I mean, I'm Nicki L-M-N-O-winsky
I mean, my name ring bells like Tinky
I mean Tinker, tell that nigga link her
’Cause I'm looking for some good brains from a thinker

Uh, thinker
Thinker... Thinker

I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
1, 2, 3rd floor, hospital bound
Niggas is doors and I knock niggas down
Straightjacket crooked, I hear you lookin
I promise I'm hard and I swear you pussy
I ain't crazy, no, yes, I am
Right up in the cuckoo nest I land
I’m fly, now eat my bird shit
Yeah, I'm crazy, crazy 'bout your bitch
Wild animal on my bewildered shit
I love brain so I'm lookin' for a nerd bitch
It's Nicki Minaj, the superb witch
And Weezy F Baby, no, Weezy F Crazy

I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy

When I do it, it get did-ed, I was fixing my fitted
Pull up in a 6 Series, she was fixing your Civic
When I do it, it gets done, 2 sticks in my bun
Pull up in a 6, hun, you was fixing to run, hoe
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
(You know, you know my name is Nicki Minaj, trick)
(Let's get it)
I get crazy, I get crazy
I get motherfuckin', motherfuckin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, that's what my name is
My name means crazy in cr-crazy languageEmbed
