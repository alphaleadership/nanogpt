1 ContributorBattlestyle Lyrics
Days are getting rainy
Just like a drunk driver
Keeps a little river in your head
Let's go so we don’t get long
This is the battlestyle!

How you looked in that picture
But you don't look so bad
Tell me why could you be so evil
I was in the mood, I was searching for something
You were in a world of their minds
You were high heeled, you were kitted your needs
They will always be there to remind me we are so very young
All that I need is someone to hеlp me be what I beliеve
I will wake up where the summer turns into a raging fire
When I do I want to be where the summer turns into a fire
And I will be leavin' my day, I will be leavin’ my home
Sticky chicky eyes, long hair, little legs
And there's someone else in this room
And I can't be there until you tell me
What's the matter with the rules you believe
They're closing the door to your mind
And no one in your life can love as much as I do
I see you standing there, far out into the races
You might also like
You know I love you but I know it only too well
And in the moment I know your soul is like an echo
Burning from the walls, burning all the wind that blows
What makes me feel that I'm ready for this world?
And you, when you've got to go
All I have to say is I'm impressed
And you could make it the movie
You’ve got to make me believe
So I can believe in you, you can make me believe
And you when you’ve got to go
All I have to say, is I'm impressed
And you could make it the movie
You’ve got to make me believe
I'm the one who understands
So when you find out that you are broken
Help you please, so you can start to heal
And you wonder if your pain is gone
I know you're only dreaming
And you'll be safe and sound
Don’t miss the healing, don't let it die
When the world is cut and stitched
So little flesh left to bury
The pain is gone, the pain is gone
The healing, the healing
The healing, the healing, the healing
Don't miss the healing, don't let it die
When the world is cut and stitched
So little flesh left to bury
I know you're only dreaming
And you'll be safe and sound
You can do it to me, you can do it to me
You can do it to me, you can do it to me (Mula!)
You can do it to me, you can do it to me
You can do it to me, you can do it to me (Yeah)

What we did was a one man show
If I seem to act strange and wild
That's just the way I can be
Is it just me, baby, or is it more than I know?
I thought I saw the future there with my eyes open wide
I can't wait to get it right
But my heart's just so tired
From being the engine of a car
That's just as I know it's meant to be
And it's a disease that only you can fix
And I'm not waiting for the wine
It's a love I've learned to hate
When you tell me you love me
You're the only one to bring me down
But when I try I'm gonna cry
You see I was meant to be here
Here I stay, but what can I do?
I've had enough of loneliness
Since you came and put a smile on my face
I know that I, I'll find you, yeah yeah
When the sun is high above
The moon is high back in town
She's got the sun in bright eyes
And the sweet little teardrops
That dance there in the summertime
She takes like a woman at the moon
The wine and the champagne
So I guess I was supposed to let my fears go
I don't know how it happened but I've gotta say
I'd say hello and they'd be laughing at me
I'd ask 'em questions that nobody understood
But by the time we got outside my room
I was searching for the missing link
In a crazy mess I made tonight
But there was no sense trying
To find myself, to find myself
I'd give up everything if it wasn't true
I'd take everything that you gave me
When the sun is shining
That makes all the shadows disappear
Like rainbows in the night
And all the time I thought that was clear
I woke up with a million questions
I've been wanting to ask 'em for time
Until you come to the door
I'll be back in two minutes
Okay, I'm back and ready
I've been wanting to ask 'em for time
Until you come to the door
You don't come unless you really must
You send me no reasons not to live
Why do you treat me cruel?
This is the way things are
You always stay in the grass
And never let that grass run free
It's the grass you always keep
And it's never giving up
It's always a move away
A real loose cannon, a true rider
Going down to the auto shop
On the highway near the train stop
And the newspapers give their marching orders
And the newspapers smile and move
The same old blue lines that carried you
Blowing through days long nightmare
You try to think of the people
Movin' on the inside, outside
We don't love, we don't laugh, no
And the way we feel today
Is we don't belong to each other
I'm moving from the frame
But I'm not trying to hide
We don't love, we don't laugh, no, no
And the things I said today
See I've been a ramblin' guy
She'll give you what you're longing for
She's waiting, make up facts for me
She'll give me what I wasn't even thinking of
She's busy making up excuses
And the truth it wasn't me
And now I've lost the chance to ever hold her
Where the love she's giving, seems to be coming back to me
I can almost harbor the ghost of a secret I've kept
Not sure if it's right or wrong
I don't want to be on my ownEmbed
