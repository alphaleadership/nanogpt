6 ContributorsTalk That Shit Lyrics(Olympicks!)

I was fishin' in some pussy yesterday and caught a nut
I swallow my pride the way you made me cough it up
Ain't afraid to die, I'm just afraid to die sober
Switchin' up my swag, bitch, my swag bipolar
Gat with that beam, give me self esteem
I murk your bitch ass just like Radio Raheem
Got this Chinese AK, that Uzi machine
That banana clip, all I need is peaches and cream
Marchin' on the moon, stompin' on the sun
French kiss a nun, with poison on my tongue
Smokin' on the good, coughin' up a lung
And you know who I be's, be's stupid and get stung
I brung some kush with me
I brung some crooks with me
And if you fishin' for greatness, you got your hooks in me
Yeah, I'm a boss and all I do is call the shots slime
We get to runnin' through your ass like a stop sign
It's Young Money, baby, we the shit, yeah
She said she wanna run her fingers through my dick hair
And she got blonde hair, I call her Rick Flair
And she be killin' me, Steve McNair, yeah

And I'm waitin' for you to talk that shit
And if you on one, I knock you off that shit, yeah
I'm waitin' for you to talk that shit
And if you on one, I knock you off that shit, yeah
Talk that shit, nigga, talk that shit
(Talk that shit, nigga, talk that shit, yeah)
(Talk that shit, nigga, talk that shit)
And if you on one, I knock you off that shit, yeahYou might also like1Embed
