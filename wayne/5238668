8 ContributorsFuck That Nigga Lyrics
All I can say is (Say is x4)
*Lighter flicker*
Fuck- fuck that other nigga (That other nigga x3)

I wish all the best, I swear I really do (I really do)
Tell that nigga don't fuck up
And I seen your ass the other day
You gaining weight, that nigga killin' you (Killin' you)
Tell his ass that I'll be over there in a minute
I got a couple of my niggas with me
He wanna put his hands on women
Can't believe the nigga trippin'
I'm on my way, until you tell a  nigga "chill"
She say "That nigga pay the bills", damn

All I can say is-
Anyway I miss you
If we were and accident, I'm glad it's one we lived through
Girl, fuck that other nigga cause you down for that nigga
Well I guess you look better when you frown to that nigga
I swear I just don't get you

And she say "I don't want to talk about it" (Talk about it)
I said "Cause when we do you always talk around it"
If you love that nigga, what you love about him
She said "Enough about him, nigga, where's yours?"
I- I said "I'm lookin' at her"
And as I glanced more
I could see what lies beneath
Like we on a glass floor
I pray we don't break it
And I pray you and that nigga don't make it
Amen
Girl, fuck that nigga (Girl, fuck that nigga x3)
You deserve the best, I swear you really do
So tell him you gon' pack the fuck up
And I seen you out the other night, drinkin' heavy
Girl, that shit ain't you
Just fuck with me and you'll get over him in a minute
I don't mean to be in your business
You just need to be with a winner, girl
Put on this glass slipper before it break
And then you tell a nigga "chill" (Nigga chill x3)
She say "That nigga pay the bills", damn
But how the fuck I'm supposed to chill (Chill x2)
Cause fairy tales ain't real, uh
You might also like
All I can say is-
Anyway I miss you
And if we were and accident, I'm glad it's one we lived through
And fuck that other nigga but you down for that nigga
Well I guess you look better when you frown to that nigga
I swear I just don't get you (Swear I just don't get you)

And she say "Can we go somewhere and talk about it?"
I said "But when we do you always talk around it" (Talk around it)
And If you love that nigga, what you love about him
She said "Enough about him, nigga, where's yours?"
I-I said "I'm lookin' at her"
And as I glanced more
I could see what lies beneath
Like we on a glass floor
I pray we don't break it
And I pray you and that nigga don't make it (Don't make it x2)
Amen
Girl, fuck that nigga (Girl, fuck that nigga x3)
Yeah, I'm hatin'
Fuck that nigga (Fuck that nigga x2)
Too ungrateful
And if you leave that nigga (Leave that nigga)
I'll be waiting
Fuck that nigga, tell him I said it
Relationship so 
Fuck him, I'm a critic
If he can't play his part, then let me audition
I'm just saying tho, girl you need a real nigga
If you gon' let him feed you lies, keep a bib with you
All I can say is-
Anyway I miss you
And if we were and accident, I'm glad it's one we lived through
Girl, fuck that other nigga you ain't down for that nigga
What happens when you no longer around for that nigga
I knew that I would get you
Too ungrateful

I'll be waitin'
Fuck that nigga
Tell him I said
