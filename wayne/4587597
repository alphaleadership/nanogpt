My mind right
I had to leave that ho alone to get my mind right
I had to leave that ho alone to get my mind right
Yeah
Yeah

I had to leave that ho alone to get my mind right
(Leave that ho alone to get my mind right)
I had to come up on a check to get my mind right
(come up on a check to get my mind right)
I had to-

Get my mind right
Money white
Hustle right
Fuck her right
Fuck it right
Fuck them pussy niggas I’ll see ‘em in another life
Woo! May my tombstone read what a life
Pussy ass nigga say he thuggin’ he a fuckin' lie
Tell him I say its a wrap like it's mummified
Hustle for a hundred days a hundred nights
Run it right
Runnin’ lights
Duckin’ lights
There he go, cut the lights
Try to spare these niggas but I put 'em on fuckin' strike
Got these niggas scrambling, and we sunny side
Come at me sideways I ride three six five days
Hot as a latte, picante, an entrée
I am the fucking best man for the job
These niggas bridesmaids, I leave niggas sideways
I don't want to hear it to me it's just blasé
I need my money ándale ándale
I got my mind right I got my mind made
But how come the early bird acting like I'm late
I'm ready for war
Money right
Hustle white
Alright
Fuckin' right
Whippin' white all night 'til a nigga knuckle white
Smoke a pound drunk a pint, another pint, another pint
B-T-W F-Y-I F-Y-L
Fuck your life L-O-L bullet shell, bloody knife
Body parts, babies crying, bitches running, bells ringing
Had to leave my heavenly bitch for a hell's angel, Lord
I l-l-licked the pussy 'til I got my L's tangled
I take CMB off the YM, I'm just spell checkin'
Yeah, I know a nigga named Rodney King
Get along with him and not with me
'Cause I'm on the edge and I'm 'bout to leave
Gun to his head make him count to three
One, two, three
BOW BOW BOW BOW
She gave me head she forgot to breathe
Straight from the bed to the shower scene
Straight from the stove to the block nigga
I do numbers you can count on me
Remember when I didn't have a pot to pee
Now I look like I done hit the lottery
Went from poverty to property
Make a mockery of a shopping spree
These niggas ain't cold they ain't hot to me
They think they like me but they not to me
Wait let me put my binoculars on
You fake as fuck as far as I can see
My eyes red as fuck look like a eye disease
I let that yopper squeeze, I sat down with me
And then I told myself, look before you kill somebody leave

*Woah, my mind right, get my mind right, ayy*
I had to come up on a check to get my mind right
*I want my money nigga*
*Come up with that check get my money right*
I had to leave that ho alone to get my mind right
(Leave that ho alone to get my mind right)
*I got my mind right, my money right, I'm ready for war*
I had to come up on a check to get my mind right
(come up on a check to get my mind right)
*Yeah, yeah, I got my mind right, my money right, I'm ready for war*

Yeah, yeah, Y-M-C-M-Beef yeah
Y-M, not them, and I'm the real Young Moolah baby
My mind right, I had to leave them boys alone to get my mind right
I had to come up on a check I want my money nigga
Come up with that check I want my money nigga
I had to leave that ho alone to get my mind right
(Leave that ho alone to get my mind right)
I had to come up on a check to get my mind right
(come up on a check to get my mind right)1Embed
