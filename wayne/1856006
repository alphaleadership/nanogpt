8 ContributorsUpgrade (Interlude) Lyrics
Yessir, three
Ha, I love this shit
So let me talk my shit, uh-huh, ha-ha
Okay, I'm good
Yeah

I know you see the guap 'cause getting money is what we on
Ridin' droptop in the winter with the heat on
Bad yellow bitch, keep my passenger seat warm
Leg hangin' out the window, you ain't got these on
Bitch, holler, it is Lil' Weezy
They cannot see me, they are like Stevie
I am bearing a ton like Levy
I circle your house like BB
Colder than the heebie-jeebies, never give freebies
Seventy-five thousand for these fees, shit
I can get a hundred thousand up in these jeans
Big stacks, my pockets on creatine
Young Money, DipSet, nigga, we a team
If you don't like it, nigga, fuck you, no Vaseline
Err, I peel off in the Lamborghin' like a tangerine
Got the engine straight shakin' like a tambourine
Like a bitch with some lips like Angeline, not Jolie
Holy, God flow, I go where no other guy go
Fuck you, ho, I'm so 5-0
Foe, I hope every snitch die slow
Hip-hop, that's my ho, I know
She know I like it wet, don't want no dry ho
Alright, bitch, I am the boy, no decoy
And I will straight up destroy any boy or man
And I prefer money than bitches, or just reefer
We are Young Money, bitch, and I am the leader
He are Curren$y, Mack Maine, and D-Raw
And I just signed a chick named Nicki MinajYou might also likeEmbed
