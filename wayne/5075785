5 ContributorsTop Notch Lyrics
DJ Fletch
Bustin' nuts in yo' baby mama

Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser (Shut the fuck up)

Watch your fuckin' main, jumpin' out the Lambina
A girl on my side, little sexy Latina
I mob in the club like the gangster Gambinos
I'm always pullin' stunts, she know niggas come stay, though
Bet I got plenty money, throw it out if she actin'
And if she let me dance, well, then, you know where my hands be
Smackin' on that jelly, know her boyfriend can't stand me
Shine like a Oscar and I bling like a Griz-ammy
You'll be mad at me when I do my thing
And I'm sellin' D and I'm sellin' drink
Tryna get to women and a cup of lean
And a bag of green, players on the scene

Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser (Young Money, um)

Wayne's World, I'm the cashier, I change girls
You can go up my crane, girl
And I might go down that drain, girl, uh
Midnight call, boy
My flow as a dog, down, boy
And my girl is a queen and she do what I say
And I say what I mean (Ah)
Then I give it to her uncut
She give her swing, then be hits like nunchucks, ha (Ah)
They give it to me, I want the best and the best in the life aren't free

Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser

I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my mama basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life
You should've been here to kick it with me
We could've split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killin' shit, they ever so talented as the Ripley
How I go from being a man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter puttin' out the hardest shit?
I should want to go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit, yeah
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser

If a nigga wanna break some bread, Project Pat got his own record copies comin' out
It's called Deep Breaker Entertainment
You know what I'm sayin'? Project Pat, don't figure
, I promote it
Stage shit, you know?
I'm just advertisin' for my nigga, I fuck with my nigga, man, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's all good, my nigga, we break bread, dawg, what we do
We get together, niggas get together, sit down at a table
