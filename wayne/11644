I'm Uptown New Orleans, like always
Cash Money boys shine like baldheads (Yeah)
Big Bezel make my watch look like a hog head (Hahahaha)
And all I do is smoke trees, call me log head (Ugh)
I'm butter on the bread, like Parkay
And I am all about me like "do re" (Haha)
I'm in the hood, in the hood like dope, yay'
Nappy-ass hair like Buckwheat, otay
Hollygrove, Eagle St. be my damn hood
Where you can murdered for free like canned goods (Ugh)
I got twelve Barbaros under the Lamb' hood
I can bring Kentucky Derby to the damn hood
Sunshine diamonds help me tan good
And I'll let it blow, like a band would
I'll call Brisco, I'm on South Beach (I'm comin')
Thirty minutes later, Opa-Locka is where I'll be (Yeah)

I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
Somebody say you was looking for me (Hah)
I'm in the hood
Like Kroger cups, watered juice, pickled eggs, and pig feet (Ugh)
If you got beef (Okay), you know just where to find me (Just where to find me)
I'm in the hood (Huh), or better yet, the projects (Ah)
Where baby mamas trippin', and them goons livin' heartless
Three rules, get money, don't tell—
And if that welfare check come late, raise hell (Hahaha, raise hell)
I'm a poor boy, I ain't got shit (Yeah)
And I hope they don't tell Baby, I'mma hit me a lick, like

Yeah! Man, I'm so Hollygrove (Ugh)
Stand strong in the water like a commodore
Black holes in your white tee: dominoes
Me and Brisco: Cash Money carnivores (Come on)
Haha, I am New Orleans like Carnival (Hahaha)
And in the hood, call me Weezy the Honorable
These other rappers so ironical
And if I ain't in the mansion, then I'm up in the Phantom or—
