Okay, I'm so G, I fuck that for leaf
I say, I make love to my gal
And I fuck the police
I say, she hold it down for daddy
When we duck the police
But I don't let her hold my gun
Cause she might tuck the police
Cause she's a gangsta

Three times lied for you
Trialed for you, ride for you
We squad (Squad Up)

I don't know (ok ok)
What you've been told but I've (what dat is) been ready
To roll and ride (what dat is)
From the day we both laid eyes (ok) on each other
So we can do (what) that Bonnie and Clyde thing, me and you (ok)
The feelin that's inside is so true (ok)
Baby boi I'm gon squad it for you

And I'm feelin that. so I
I need a girl that knows the ups and downs, and knows to
Go down and get up when I touch down
Keep a nigga up when I touch ground
Keep her nigga nature up, keep a nigga neighbors up with them fuck sounds
Financially stable so she livin' plush now
Plus she can roll, cook it, and bag it and cut now
Now we at the table when tryin to discuss vows
I know we young, but fuck y'all

I don't know (ok ok)
What you've been told but I've (what dat is) been ready
To roll and ride (what dat is)
From the day we both laid eyes (ok) on each other
So we can do (what) that Bonnie and Clyde thing, me and you (ok)
The feelin that's inside is so true (ok)
Baby boi I'm gon squad it for you

I know she feelin' me, shit
I no she wantin' me
