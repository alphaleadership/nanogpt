8 ContributorsMiss My Dawgs Lyrics
Man, I miss my dawgs
The ones I pick up for, ain't never missed a call
Plottin' to get it poppin', we had plans to get it all
Wishin' you was here, dawg, to ride these foreign cars (Ride these foreign cars)
Man, I miss my dawgs
Thuggin' on the block, really pistol in the drawers
Tryna make it out the hood, my dawg had a cause
Fuck all the ops and fuck the law, they did him fraud (They did him fraud)

My dawg is one who ride for me
They want try me for a body, they gon' slide for free (Slide for free)
Wherever I be steppin', they on side of me
Bros over hoes, built off loyalty and honesty
My dawgs kept it honest with me, no if, ands, or probablys
You ain't my dog if we ain't ever do no robberies (No robberies)
We had a cause, we was tryna hit the lottery (Lottery)
Young niggas ball, we was making it out of poverty (Poverty)
We did our thang, we did our thang, we did it properly (Properly)
Tell on your dawgs, I'll never
When I could tell them somethin' slick, I'm too clever
I wish my dawgs more life, Hugh Hefner (Hugh Hefner)
You know I wrote this for my steppers

Man, I miss my dawgs
The ones I pick up for, ain't never missed a call
Plottin' to get it poppin', we had plans to get it all
Wishin' you was here, dawg, to ride these foreign cars (Ride these foreign cars)
Man, I miss my dawgs
Thuggin' on the block, really pistol in the drawers
Tryna make it out the hood, my dawg had a cause
Fuck all the ops and fuck the law, they did him fraud (They did him fraud)

Man, I miss my dawgs
Bad-ass memories, but I can't forget my dawgs
Niggas act like kittens, tryna scratch a nigga off
All my niggas pits, and I spit like a saint bernard (Grrr)
I don't bark though, that's my dawg show
She a dog ho, she on all four
All my dawgs at, at the crossroads
If all dogs go to heaven, then my dawgs go
Yeah, dog food, I be eatin' pussy like dog food
Only got the judgement, no law school
Her tongue stick out her mouth, and her jaws drool
I'm in that double R, no roof-roof, nigga
And I want that smoke like soup too, nigga
I'm a big dog like Snoop too nigga
I fuck wit' YG, like woop-woop, nigga
No Goof Troop, nigga, I'm a dawg

Man, I miss my dawgs
The ones I pick up for, ain't never missed a call
Plottin' to get it poppin', we had plans to get it all
Wishin' you was here, dawg, to ride these foreign cars (Ride these foreign cars)
Man, I miss my dawgs
Thuggin' on the block, really pistol in the drawers
Tryna make it out the hood, my dawg had a cause
Fuck all the ops and fuck the law, they did him fraud (They did him fraud)Embed
