1 ContributorNo Love (Hedegaard Club Remix) Lyrics
Throw dirt on me
Throw dirt on me
Throw dirt on me
And grow a wildflower
Throw dirt on me
Throw dirt on me
Throw dirt on me
And grow a wildflower
Throw dirt on me
Throw dirt on me
Throw dirt on me
And grow a wildflower
Throw dirt on me
Throw dirt on me
A wildflower
A wildflower

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Don't hurt me)
That's right, it don't (Don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And I don't need you don't (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you
Don't wanna see you
You might also like
Don't wanna see you
Don't wanna see you
Don't wanna see you
Don't wanna see you
Don't wanna
Don't wanna
Don't wanna
Don't wanna
Don't wanna
Don't wanna
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch

Love

What is Love
What is Love

Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "Fuck the world," get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I ain't never giving in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (Yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause
I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man, get these wack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (Oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (Yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (Yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
And you can never break my stride (Nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment, I'm 'bout to blow
You'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom and the opponent is gettin' no
Mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Don't hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (Don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around

That's right, you don't (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Don't hurt me)
