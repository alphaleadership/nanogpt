Kyuh, Young Mula, baby
Good morning New York, what up New Orleans
What you want me to do Weezy? Get 'em, baby
Alright, daddy, Nicki Lewinsky

I got a fetish for boys that's pushin' them nice toys (Kyuh)
A fetish for dem boys that's fresher than altoids
I got a thing for a dude in a fresh pair of Mauri's
If he rockin' 'em right, then I might let him call me (Yo)
He put the Prada bag, wit' the Prada heels with it
The Louis dufflebag, had about a mil' in it (Nicki Minaj)
From here to Trinidad, man, I should've been did it (Why?)
'Cause everything I had, I just doubled them digits
That's the kinda dude that can roll with the President
Sit up in the Rolls maybe, roll to my residence
Stay around Fendi (Okay), he love my spaghetti
He let me do my thing, he don't never act petty (Word)
If he ringin', I'm dippin', put the ring in my lip and
I just give 'em wink, what the fuck did you think?
Now he spendin' and trickin', so the chickens is trippin'
I'm like (Kyuh), I'm like (Kyuh), I'm like (Kyuh, hahahaha)

That's what my girls say, everyday my birthday
Young Money, sippin' Rosé when we thirsty (Young Money)
Kyuh, kyuh (Kyuh)
Okay, come on
Good evening New York
You might also like
That mean I live by the beach
Sand on the welcome mat, flyer than a Falcon
Black tires, black rims, just to help 'em look good
In the summer, my car look better than your woman
My woman look better than your momma
And I don't wanna name, or number, just some brain from her, nah
I ain't came in a Hummer, that's a Bentley Marlow on her
I'm nasty on the beat like the runners, I'm a gunner
Like a hunter with a gun, with a deer right in front 'em
I'ma send 'em to who brung him, let Nina Ross tongue him
Oh, back to the subject, I'm ballin' without a budget
I'm a big spender, but I ain't done yet
I'ma keep that shit runnin', like I’m Marshall Faulk's son and
On a Sunday,I’m Devin Hester, you don’t want to punt it
You do it but I done it, I stun it, I spun it

That's what my girls say (Ya dig?), everyday my birthday
Young Money, sippin' Rosé when we thirsty (Young Mula, baby)
Kyuh, kyuh (Kyuh)
Uh-huh, okay (Nicki Minaj, the mistress, ya dig?), come on

Nicki Minaj, man, a.k.a Nicki Lewinsky, man
What's up New York, man
Dirty Money, Fendi, I see you
Young Mula, baby
Ayy, Big Spender
Yeah, like I said, man, Nicki Minaj
You bitches open up your pussies and get ready, yeah
Nicki Lewinsky, the mistress, don't tell her I said thatEmbed
