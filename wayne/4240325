6 ContributorsI Get Crazy Lyrics
I get crazy, I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy, I-I get crazy

I just came out of the motherfuckin' old school
Got my Mac Notebook with the Pro Tools
You bitches ain't ready for Nicki Lewinsky
Bad woof woof, flyer than a Frisbee
So I'm up in Mandalay, eating mangos
Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star, they say I'm a Star Spangle
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-banner, I am the rap Hannah
Mo-Mon-Montana, so fix your antenna
I keep three hoes but don't call me Santa
And I am flyer then reindeer in the winter (in the winter)

Is it a bird or a plane?
No, no, Teyana is the name
So you say you wanna fly?
Well, follow me and take flight, my turn
Baby, I'm so attention, I'm a center
Not to mention, they go crazy when I enter
I'm a realist so they figure I'm a hipster
Bury the birds, look at the curves, I'm limper
I'm swaggin', I'm braggin', I'm stuntin', I'm prattlin'
I dress so dip, you're sick 'cause I'm slicker than Rick
And when I heard the instrumental, told them "gimme a clip"
I'm murderin' this, I must really like this, shh
It's me, the new generation of rap
It's T, lowkey, and I lay in the back
What, you was waitin' for a nigga   in rap?
Nah, B, but you can keep hopin' for that
You might also like
I get crazy, I get crazy, I get crazy, I get crazy, I get crazy
I get crazy, I get crazy, I get crazy, I get crazy

1, 2, 3rd floor, hospital bound
Niggas is doors and I knock niggas down
Straightjacket crooked, I hear you lookin
I promise I'm hard and I swear you pussy
I ain't crazy, no, yes, I am
Right up in the cuckoo nest I land
I'm fly, now eat my bird shit
Yeah, I'm crazy, crazy 'bout your bitch
Wild animal on my bewildered shit
I love brain so I'm lookin' for a nerd bitch
It's Nicki Minaj, the superb witch
And Weezy F Baby, no, Weezy F Crazy

I get crazy, I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy, I-I get crazyEmbed
