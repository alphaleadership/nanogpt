My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Boy toy named Troy
Used to live in Detroit
Bi-bi-big dope dealer money
He was gettin' some coins
Wa-wa-was in shootouts with the law
But he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen
He was keepin' me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse
Bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who-who-who-who wanna go first?
I had 'em pushin' daffodils
I'm high as hell
I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

By-by-by-by-by-by the way, what he say? (Hey, hey)
He can tell I ain't missing no meals (Hey)
Come through and fuck him in my automobile (Hey)
Let him eat it with his grills, he keep tellin' me to chill
He keep tellin' me it's real, that he love my sex appeal (Hey)
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab (Hey)
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like (Hey)
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun (Hey, hey)

My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh
Look at her butt
Oh my gosh
Look at her butt
Oh-oh-oh-oh my gosh
Look at her butt
Look at her butt, look at, look at, look at
Look at her butt

Thi-thi-thi-thi-this dude named Michael
Used to ride motorcycles
Di-di-dick bigger than a tower
I ain't talkin' 'bout Eiffel's
Re-re-re-real country-ass
Nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep
Now he callin' me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad
Like his name Romaine
And when we done
I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit
By-by-by-by-by-by the way, what he say? (Hey, hey)
He can tell I ain't missing no meals (Hey)
Come through and fuck him in my automobile (Hey)
Let him eat it with his grills, he keep tellin' me to chill
He keep tellin' me it's real, that he love my sex appeal (Hey)
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab (Hey)
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like (Hey)
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun (Hey, hey)

My anaconda don't
