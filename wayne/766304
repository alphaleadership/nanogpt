4 ContributorsHow to Love (Spanglish Remix) Lyrics
Cut the music up (Wuh)
A little louder, yeah

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love (Hmm)
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love (Hmm)
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love (Hey), never had a love (Hey)

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adiós
Me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar, como amar
La vida va pasando, tu carita no ha cambiado
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar (Hey), como amar (Hey)

¿Te acuerdas de esa noche? Éramos adolescentes
Quería darte un beso, y tú tan inocente
Me tenía locamente enamorado, me tenias locamente enamorado
Y ya lo ves, lo que fue ya fue
Y te marchaste poco a poco de mi lado
Y yo sigo locamente enamorado, aquí sigo locamente enamorado

Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adiós
Me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar, como amar
La vida va pasando, tu carita no ha cambiado
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar, how to love (Oh)

See, I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual (Hey), far from the usual (Hey)

You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
La vida va pasando, tu carita no ha cambiado
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar, como amar (How to love, oh hmm)
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love (Como amar)
La vida va pasando, tu carita no ha cambiado
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar, como amar (Hmm)Embed
