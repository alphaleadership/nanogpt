Uh, Medicine Man, Medicine Man (Yeah)
Taking off never to land  (Woo)
United we fall, together we stand (Yeah)
I pop a whole, she took a half
I'm feelin' gold, she lookin' tan
It never gets old, she never get mad
We too high to fuck, I never hit that
Cotton candy, sweet as gold
Make that pussy open-close
She take her meds up her nose
Lookin' like she smelled a rose
It says Hermès on my clothes
20 mg, that's my dose
I fucked her off one of those
She act like she saw a ghost
Wake up baby, comatose
Wake up baby, vamonos
Sleeping like we on an island, somewhere in Galapagos
It's lonely at the top, we hold hands and Geronimo
100 percent cotton, oxymoron, Oxy-Oxy-Oxy, mmm

Matchy-matchy, nigga, just stop it
Niggas always try to copy
Drinkin' saké, Hachi Tachi
I eat beef, Johnny Rocket
Over the bowl, in the faucet
Crank that ho, John Gotti
Ben Frank, meet the pocket
Pocket watchin', pick a pocket, mm
Richard Mille prolly
Got me lookin' cocky
Drinkin' in the lobby, ayy
Catch it, Jeremy Shockey
Cuban link my wallet, ayy, and it's camouflagin'
It ain't no discussion, ayy
Better hit your target
Bentley with the roof, uh
Got Versace carpet
Sippin' lean like soup, uh
Yeah, Hachi Tachi
I'ma pop an X, uh

Look at my bih, Oxy
Look at my clique, Oxy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh)

Talk about Oxy, talk about Molly
Perc 3-0, turned me into a zombie
Got drip on drip, Amiri, Givenchy
Got head from two hoes in the party
Call her a bitch like she a Bluenose
She want a Judo, kick it karate
I got a new hoe, plus a few hoes and they all like getting naughty
Off the Oxy, I been out here off the Oxy
Ball on shit like Kamikaze
Boss shit, nigga, I'm your father
All shit, I feel like the hardest
On that rocket, off the Oxy
Ballin' like I'm Mr. Harden
I don't beg for shit, so why you think I'm finna beg my pardon?
Everyday, I murder instrumentals
You a fuck nigga, then I ain't fucking with you
I dunk on a bitch like a Rocket, nigga
Eating good everyday like it's supper, nigga
Bye, I'm lonely, I don't say what's up to niggas
Fuck a Rollie, the AP on me, nigga
Only rolling if I got my woadie with me
Off the Oxy, I ride on the road to riches
Oxycontin, Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Look at my wrist, Oxy
Look at my bitch, Oxy
Oxycontin, Oxycontin
Oxycontin, Oxycontin
Look at my bih, Oxy
Look at my clique, Oxy

Yeah, I got some pills, yeah, I got the Perc'
Yeah, I got this big booty bitch in my vert
And I got a room, and it's downtown
And my white bitch might give me head first3Embed
