4 ContributorsSorry (Remix) Lyrics
You feel me?

I get to the money with ease (Ease)
I'm different, they jacking my steez (Swag)
I'm the new wave, it's a breeze (Burr)
Not praying, and she on her knees
I just might go get the 'Rari (Skrrt)
OG game like an Atari
NDA's outside my party (Check)
Humble, but sorry, not sorry (Sorry)

Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (I'm sorry)
Uh, sorry, not sorry (Nah)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Nah)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Haha)

I just might go buy a house (Yes)
Then I might just go buy another one (Uh)
I'ma put one on the market (Ok)
Then far furnish the other one (Woo)
I'm talkin' all outta pocket (Mmm)
Make me go on another run
Already know how we rockin' (Know)
If I win, my brothers won (Twice)
Two hundred on the dash (Yes)
Speed chase with the troopers (Woo-woo)
I'm with all the smoke, just not with the hookah (Never)
When you own the building (Uh-huh?)
You can evict the super (Get out)
Garage is full of machines (Mmm)
You can go switch the Coupé up (Uh)
Don't feel sorry for me (Nah)
If I end up makin' that call (Uh)
'Cause after that, whatever happens (What)
And I am not sorry at all, nah
You might also like
Pull up on 'em in a Bentley (Bentley)
Hard top for two-fifty (Fifty)
Paid cash, all century
Paperwork with some whiskey (Uh)
I just be handling biz' (I do)
Don't know what a manager is (I don't)
They need to have me on Cribs (They do)
Feel like I abandoned my kid (Kid)
Infinity pool in the back (Back)
Your chick wanna fool with a mack (Mack)
She asking around for my jack (Jack)
But she only one in the pack (Uh)
I fly on the jet to relax (Relax)
Shrimp and champagne for the snack (The snack)
Suckers wan' hit me with a dap (Dap)
Fifty-fifty, get the strap (Baow)

I get to the money with ease (Ease)
I'm different, they jacking my steez (Swag)
I'm the new wave, it's a breeze (Burr)
Not praying, and she on her knees
I just might go get the 'Rari (Skrrt)
OG game like an Atari
NDA's outside my party (Check)
Humble, but sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (I'm sorry)

Her face full of sorrow, fuck 'til I see tears of joy, she cry
Ooh, yeah, and I am not sorry for all of these charges

And we are not sorry, nigga, we are soaring, yeah, yeah
And I am not sorry at all, Mula
