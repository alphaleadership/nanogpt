AXL
Yeah, ah
Huh, ha-ah

Ain't playin' with niggas (Yeah)
'Cause we are them niggas (We are them niggas)
We roll like gorillas (We roll like gorillas)
We are the winners (And we are the realest)
Grew up with the hitters (Hitters)
We came from the city of killers (A city of killers, right)
We are the littest (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Like Wayne, I got no ceilings (No, I have no ceilings)
Where is the ceilings? (Where is the ceilings?)
I see no ceilings (I see no ceilings)
We got no feelings (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We, you know we got no feelings (Oh, right)
Our brothers that sit in the cage (Yeah)
We miss ya (Yeah)
Niggas go out in a blaze (Ah)
Making hard decisions

Livin' through tension (Ooh)
Friends get distant (Ooh)
Diamond on glisten (Ah)
They don't wanna mention you (Ah)
Video instant views (Ahh)
Bitches wanna pick and choose (Pick and choose)
Diamond like a big igloo
My nigga, we runnin' for days, know we got the vision (Hm)
Livin' life fast in the lane, hope we don't collision (Nah)
We ain't fin' to lose, she looking at my Finsta, too
She become an instant boo (Ahh-ahh-ahh)

We are the winners (And we are the realest)
Grew up with the hitters (Hitters)
We came from the city of killers (A city of killers, alright)
We are the littest (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Like Wayne, I got no ceilings (No, I have no ceilings)
Where is the ceilings? (Where is the ceilings?)
I see no ceilings (I see no ceilings)

Making hard decisions

VVS's on me, look how a heavy hitter step (Heavy hitter step)
He try to flex with his shit in the club, we took his chains off his neck (Chains off his neck)
They know I like to keep it cool, but killers with me gon' make a mess (Brr)
I got a check and flew out to Miami but they know the K is what I rep (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
She say she love me I ain't say I love her, but she know I love to give her sex (Hold on)
She pull up on me, I'ma give her dick, ain't no reason for me to send a text (Ah)
I'm in this bitch with the Trap Lord in the trap and we cookin' a mess (We cookin' it up)
Lamborghini, 220 the dashboard, switch it up and go hop it a 'Vette (Uh-huh)
She get a Birkin (Birkin), she get a big bag if we fuck (Bag)
I got a big bag full of Runtz (Bag full of Runtz), I'm putting straight gas in the blunt
I tell her twerk it, she give me straight ass 'til I'm done
She doin' anything a nigga say, if I tell you suck it do it 'til I cum (Ah)
Ain't playin' with niggas (Yeah)
'Cause we are them niggas (We are them niggas)
We roll like gorillas (We roll like gorillas)
We are the winners (And we are the realest)
Grew up with the hitters (Hitters)
We came from the city of killers (A city of killers, right)
We are the littest (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Like Wayne, I got no ceilings (No, I have no ceilings)
Where is the ceilings? (Where is the ceilings?)
I see no ceilings (I see no ceilings)
We got no feelings (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We, you know we got no feelings (Oh, right)
Our brothers that sit in the cage (Yeah)
We miss ya (Yeah)
Niggas go out in a blaze (Ah)
Making hard decisions

I got no ceilings, I never had 'em, nigga
Pop me a handle bar, then I handle business
I'm on that Actavis, call it activism
I like my chinchillas soft as caterpillars
I got no issues, but I got ammunition case I got issues
Chop a kilo down like paper and scissor
China white, bitch, I'm breaking the dishes
Hands down, bitch, I'm too out of hand
Hands up, I kill you with my hands
Masked up like I flew from Japan
Bap, bap, that's for you and your man
No cap, cap, I don't do it with words
Flap, flap, that's my wings you just heard
Yeah, kidnap anything for them birds
No trap rap, I'm way in the suburbs
Rolls Royce, stars came on the roof
But I removed the roof and we can see the stars, bitch
I got dogs on the loose
Now, you can call a truce but I can call 'em off, bitch
I got dogs that don't roof
Got bitches fallin' through and niggas fallin' off shit
I ain't got no fuckin' feelings, got you catchin' fuckin' feelings
Fuck your feelings, bitch
Ain't playin' with niggas (Yeah)
'Cause we are them niggas (We are them niggas)
We roll like gorillas (We roll like gorillas)
We are the winners (And we are the realest)
Grew up with the hitters (Hitters)
We came from the city of killers (A city of killers, alright)
We are the littest (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Like Wayne, I got no ceilings (No, I have no ceilings)
Where is the ceilings? (Where is the ceilings?)
I see no ceilings (I see no ceilings)
We got no feelings (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We, you know we got no feelings (Oh, right)
Our brothers that sit in the cage (Yeah)
We miss ya (Yeah)
Niggas go out in a blaze (Ah)
