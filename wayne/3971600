A sorry's not easy to change
When the love you know slips away
But all I know is that too much is not enough
And that's why you the one I hold onto
Good poison love
Ahh-ahh-ahh


A sorry's not easy to change
When the love you know slips away
But all I know is that too much is not enough
And that's why you the one I hold onto
Good poison love
Ahh-ahh-ahh


A sorry's not easy to change
When the love you know slips away
But all I know is that too much is not enough
And that's why you the one I hold onto
Good poison love
Ahh-ahh-ahhYou might also like1Embed
