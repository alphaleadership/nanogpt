Ball like the playoffs
Get down or lay down
Lay down and stay down
Ball like the playoffs
Can't take a day off
Can't take a day off
Ball like the playoffs
Get down or lay down
Lay down and stay down
Can't take a play off
Can't take a day off
Can't take a day off

Ball like the playoffs, ball like the playoffs, ball like the playoffs
Can't take a play off, can't take a play off, can't take day off
Ball like the playoffs, ball like the playoffs, can't take a day off
Can't take a play off, can't take a play off
Ball like the playoffs

Ball like the playoffs, get down or lay down
Lay down and stay down
Can't take a play off, can't take a day off
Working my A' off
It's  day now
Sun up to sun down, we litty light up now
That's on my bust down
Pressure it bust pipes, but we so piped up now
We so piped up now, they better pipe down
They better point now, they know it's 4th down
Ain't no more time-outs, Hail Mary touchdown
Run up the score on the opposition
We win the game it's a celebration
Hold up the trophy my momma watching
I'm 'bout to make a confetti angel

Ball like the playoffs, ball like the playoffs, ball like the playoffs
Can't take a play off, can't take a play off, can't take day off
Ball like the playoffs, ball like the playoffs, can't take a day off
Can't take a play off, can't take a play off
Ball like the playoffs

Don't get stepped on (Stepped on)
Your team get sent home (Sent home)
We just bring rings home, we got a bust down (Bust down)
Your team get bust down, you gon' be the one first down
No one get cut out (Cut out), but we makin' cuts now (Yeah)
I think they tryna rush now, it's up to us now (Yeah)
Ain't no fearin' fourth down, Hail Mary touchdown
You'll get stepped on (Stepped on), the weak get stepped on (Yeah)
New cleats game, we who that we are
I'ma put the MAc's on, I'ma bring the racks home
Go out or go home (Huh), can't end my team, we can't take home (Huh)
Bring it on, it ain't gon' take long (Huh)
Then do my dance in your endzone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Ball like the playoffs, ball like the playoffs, ball like the playoffs
Can't take a play off, can't take a play off, working my A' off
Ball like the playoffs, ball like the playoffs, working my A' off
Can't take a play off, can't take a play off
Ball like the playoffs
Cleats get stepped on, cleats get stepped on
Chins get checked on, game just kept goin'
No brakes pressed on, no cap, jet gone
Jet fuel, kept going
Teams get slept on, dreams get slept on
Teams get crept on, the elite take the best of 'em
And the rest get left home
Say it with your chest bone, no brakes pressed on
No cap, jet gone, jet fuel, kept going
Teams get slept on, dreams get slept on
Say it with your chest bone, no brace pressed on
No cap, jet gone, jet fuel, kept going
No cap, jet gone, get on then get left home

Ball like the playoffs
Can't take a play off, can't take a day off
Working my A' off
Ball like the playoffs
