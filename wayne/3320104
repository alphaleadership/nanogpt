5 ContributorsSqad Shit (Grindinâ€™) Lyrics
Yo, yeah what up world - SQAD Shit
I go by the name of Weezy
He go by the name of Nut and
He go by the name of Gutta
And we-

Bitch I'm Sqad for life
Hit ya one time, and if you don't die
Bitches scarred for life
Yall niggas hermaphrodites
Better grip ya torch is tight
When we park and cut off the lights
We'll hold the fight
Believe these lil' dawgs'll bite
I'm talkin' phsyc' when I'm on or off the mic
In the rawest night, you gon' afford the price
Call us soft or dark or light
Jus because my voice is light
The bottom of my arms is bright
The chrome is right here, stand right on the site
You don't wanna be in that place
Wit' ya mom with a sad face
While they go and put your ashes in that vase
Gimme room, gimme, get back, space
Fore I fix it where yo jaw can't git back strait
And the streets is too raw, it can't get back safe
If a Josh should kiddy on the strength of the weight
Look I'm not a white boy, not a new kid on the block
Want the white boy holla, the kid on the block, ya know
You might also like
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
It's that Sqad shit, yeah, yeah
That's that that Sqad shit, yeah, yeah
That Sqad shit, oh, oh
Sqad shit, yeah
Sqad shit, yeah
This some Sqad shit, holla at cha boy

It's like a nigga don't get no sleep
I'm tryna be the first nigga up so I can murk the streets
Sit flock fat rocks, got a bag of trees
Fuckin' pigs on my ass, so they taxin' me
(J.Gutter) I gives a fuck let them bastards be
(J.Gutter) I got a hundred trash bags of weed
(J.Gutter) give it the fee and move rapidly
(J.Gutter) Supa in the kitchen and he wrappin' ki's
I'm on the block, nigga puttin' in work
Hustle hard from first to first, but wait it gets worst
I gotta get it 'til I'm lyin' in a hearse
Dreams to lockdown, souf side of the earth
I'ma be Gudda til I'm lyin' in the dirt
These niggas askin' if I'm dyin' to a nurse
Nigga I'm hustla, I'ma grind 'til it hurts
It's Gudda Gudda, bitch
Yea, I'm a hustler baby, I just want you to know, yeah
And I love me some ki's, quarters ounces and O's
Nah, while this 'bout to bubble, so put it in there fast
To take all this crack and go flood the ave
Cuttin' back, crums to grams
From hand to hand, dubs to grands
From the slums to them industry club jams
I keep it jumpin', Supa my frontman
Because I gotta do this rap shit jus for a front end
And if I ever see the day my music bum-bump
Back to the block to pump sand
Know how to live call me young man
And shit I did it for my daddy
And understand if you lookin' for pitcture round that nigga in the alley
What? Niggas still got it all the time, just find me
True hustlers never stops to grind, I'm grindin'
When the drought come around some prices go up, my numbers come down
Nigga got hovers, got pounds, got bundles
Slick with the hustle
Weezy leave you with the itch and the uptown shuffle
Gimme a plate
Come through with that shit that they had back in '88
Balloons of heroine, silver packs are 88
Crazy wait paper straight
Lazy eye Mercedes 5
Slow and drive
We don't need the cop to pull us over got that blow in inside
Man the bitch ain't got no in size
'Cause it stop with the yay from the floor up
Come tell Weezy wee you need that yola
I got more coke than coca-cola
Ima solja holdin down the nolaEmbed
