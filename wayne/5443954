8 ContributorsCount On You (Remix) Lyrics
Actavis got me drippin like Activator
Can I count on you and throw away my calculator?
I just need someone to count on
And up in here you don't need all that clout on
We catching feelings like Mahomes do with the side arm
Like hut two
Me plus you equals us two
One, two, one, two, she said, "You can count on me and come too"
I said, "Ooh", she said, "Ooh-wee", she said, "Bathe me, wipe me, boo me"
She say, "Choke me, bite me, screw me"
She say, "Hold me like you lose me"
I say, "Long throat, you gon' make me keep it like a hundo
Your love though, make the wind shine and the sun blow"
What? No, I mean the wind blow and the sun shine
And even with these half shut eyes, I can still see the upside
That's a love high, a body high
You a problem, bae, I'm tryna add you to that 99
Subtract the stars and count the skies
Your thighs divide and me plus you is eye to eye
I dot the I's, you're Einstein
And can I count on you?

Count on you
Can I count on you?
Count on you, ooh, ooh, ooh?
All I ever wanted was a way back
All you ever wanted was me
I'm just asking, babe
Can I count on you, ooh, ooh, ooh?
All I ever wanted was a way back
All you ever wanted was me
I'm just asking, babe
Can I count on you, ooh, ooh, ooh? (Can I count on you and throw away my calculator?)
You might also like
I lie way too much (Woo)
We keep breaking up
Call me on my bluff
Guess you know me
Yeah, you know me (Yeah)

Young, wild, living for the moment
Sometimes I don't even notice
Fuckin' with your heart'll leave me lonely (Lonely)
Can I count on you?
Count on you
Can I count on you?
Can I count on you, ooh, ooh, ooh?

All I ever wanted was a way back
All you ever wanted was me
I'm just asking, babe
Can I count on you, ooh, ooh, ooh?
All I ever wanted was a way back
All you ever wanted was me
I'm just asking, babe
Can I count on you, ooh, ooh, ooh? (Can I count on you and throw away my calculator?)
All I ever wanted was a way back
All you ever wanted was me
I'm just asking, babe
Can I count on you, ooh, ooh, ooh?
All I ever wanted was a way back
All you ever wanted was me
I'm just asking, babe (Actavis got me drippin like Activator)
Can I count on you, ooh, ooh, ooh? (Can I count on you and throw away my calculator?)
Count on you
Can I, can I count on you?
Count on you (Can I count on you and throw away my calculator?)3Embed
