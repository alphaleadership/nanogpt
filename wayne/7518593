5 ContributorsManeater (Timbaland Remix) Lyrics
(Take it back to the top)
Baby please don't eat me up, eat me up, eat me up
Baby please don’t eat me up, eat me up, eat me up
Baby please don't eat me up, eat me up, eat me up
Baby please don't eat me up, eat me up, eat me up

See...
My shortie know what she doing
Lick her lips and get straight to it
When she do it, I say "Ooh it... feels so good"
"Ooh so good, you so good", I’m so hood
Take her to the block, tell her don't even trip
I'ma stop right here, get a bag of that piff
We can roll it on up and take that lift
Hi, my name is Wayne, I came to get paid
And lotta other miscellaneous things
Stand up guy but came to get laid
Where's my bed? What I said... is what I mean
And you can take that to the head
I just come to do my thing, gotta keep that maneater fed
Dreads swangin;', while I'm bangin'
When I'm finished, still bangin, yup!
I don’t know what you was thinking
But I’m young and I been drinking, now
Hop on up in this spankin' new, drippin’ wet Mercedez coupe
Got the thang lookin like a shiney suit
Now imagine that with me and you
I be Diddy, you be Mase
Eat me up, enjoy the taste
If I be wit it, don't be faint
I'ma put it right there for you on that plate
Come on, call me Young Weezy Baby, Baby, aye, yes
I'm a m-m-mouthful now lemme see you digest
See Nelly Furtado LiveGet tickets as low as $67You might also like
Everybody look at me, me
I walk in the door, you start screaming
Come on, everybody, what you here for?
Move your body around like a nympho
Everybody get your necks to crack around
All you crazy people, come on, jump around
I wanna see you all on your knees, knees
You either wanna be with me, or be me
(Come on, now)

Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard, make you want all of her love
She’s a maneater, make you buy cars
Make you cut cards, make you fall real hard in love
She's a maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard, make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars
Make you cut cards, wish you never ever met her at all

Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh

She's a maneater, make you buy cars
Make you cut cards, make you fall real hard in love
She's a maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard, make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars
Make you cut cards, wish you never ever met her at all

You wish you never ever met her at all
You wish you never ever met her at all
You wish you never ever met her at all
You wish you never ever met her at all
You wish you never ever met her at all
