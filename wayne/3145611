40 ContributorsMula Gang Lyrics
Man, startin' five when it's game time (Dawg, ayy)
Talkin' drugs on my main line
That's a strange sign, can't really trust you (Okay)
Ain't have a clue that I was workin' so hard to get where I'm at
I can vision this shit, had a dream, call me Jay Luther King
Now I woke up and I'm livin' this shit
Time change, people change too (Right?), never let the people change you (Right?)
Pack made it safe, we straight (Woo), pull off in a cocaine coupe (Skrrt)
Got two snow bunnies with me (Yeah), one Becky one named Sue (Yeah)
Sue don't really do what Becky do (Yeah), Becky sexual with the crew
Gang, 2000 at HollyGrove, this the year of the Mula, I put that on Mula (Who want it?)
Pull out the passports, fuck a city ho, I need a bitch from Aruba (Gone)
She say my dick like a ruler (Woo), she let me fuck her medulla
Then I pass that ho to Euro, when it come to head, that ho better than Super, I'm gone (Hey, hey)

Wait, I think I'm made for this shit (Hey)
I got the way with this shit (Hey), grind every day for this shit (Woo, woo)
Every night, bad hoes (Gang), shop open, no closed (Gang)
Make money, stack more (Gang), I guess that's what they ask for (Gang)

Wait, yeah (Woo), Mula Gang (Yeah)
Woo, man (Yeah), Mula Gang
Yeah, yeah (Gang), Mula Gang (Woo)
Gang, yeah (Woo), Mula Gang

Check, I'ma do 'em like Big Meech, this strip club's in '03
Like when MJ dropped sixty-nine on the Cavs in OT
Keith Moore with a low fade, fiends still in the Stone Age
Goons in the crowd strapped hope, they don't clap while I'm on stage
Side talk, I'm immune to, been the new kid in the new school
I ain't too fond of the new school, I'm an old soul in a young man
Bump Johnny Cash when I cruise through, two cokes still a hot boy
But I'm too cool, I'll hold a grudge 'til I beat whoever I lose to
We the ones who had good girls by the pool snortin' up lines
I'm the reason all the bad college bitches never showed up on time
We the one who had Cristiano in Japan throwin' up signs (Signs)
Born to lose but I built up, always knew growin' up I
I think I'm made for this shit

Wait, I think I'm made for this shit (Hey)
I got the way with this shit (Hey), grind every day for this shit (Woo, woo)
Every night, bad hoes (Gang), shop open, no closed (Gang)
Make money, stack more (Gang), I guess that's what they ask for (Gang)

Wait, yeah (Woo), Mula Gang (Yeah)
Woo, man (Yeah), Mula Gang
Yeah, yeah (Gang), Mula Gang (Woo)
Gang, yeah (Woo), Mula Gang
I'm Steph Curry, I'm Wardell, I'm all hell
When the Warriors come out to play, y'all all fail
I got fish scale, I got four scales
I'm the nigga in the city pushin' dope deals
HoodyBaby in the kitchen when the smoke clears
I can clear two-hunnid thousand like my throat, yeah
I make it rumble in the jungle where koalas lie
Bitches call me HoodyBear, i'm koala-fied
Oh that went over your head? I'm over qualified
Really make them guns fly, bitch I'm stuck in overdrive
Trick or treat, live or die? Let my bro decide
All this trappin' in my Jesus piece like show you right

L.A.T, Moms was hard on me with grades
Had to turn them Bs to A, now I'm turning words to paper
Turnin' birds to haters, fry their wings and legs
I prefer a leg, I deserve a raise
Should be overpaid, I just toast the bread
I ain't burn the bread, made it gold instead
Turning more than heads, take a lemon head
Turn it into bread, got the golden dreads
Got me on the meds, had a talk with Tez
About me on the meds, forgot the shit he said
I'm out here on the edge, don't try to sell me, Reg
I'll knock you off the ledge, I'll pop off on sketch
Prayin' like pledge, bullets gon' spread
Catch 'em like Dez, all in your ass
Handguns in the console, I'm a shark in the fishbowl
Runnin' plays on my rich hoes, sunny days in the North Pole
I'm a player, play my part, ho, turn a rock to the charcoal
Heart throb but my heart close, short ride on a long road
Long days and them long nights, big dogs, yeah, we all bite
Big words, just all hype, small talk, large price
Alright, not nice, heart cold, hot ice
She sucks, she wipes, she swallows, drops mic
Stop light, stop runnin' your mouth 'fore I run in your mouth
From a hundred dollas to a hundred accounts
Got fuckin' problems, tryna figure 'em out
Niggas run in your house waitin' on my count
Bitches in they house waiting on my call
Mula Gang, Mula Gang, Mula Gang, yes, Lord
I think I'm made for this shit
Wait, I think I'm made for this shit (Hey)
I got the way with this shit (Hey), grind every day for this shit (Woo, woo)
Every night, bad hoes (Gang), shop open, no closed (Gang)
Make money, stack more (Gang), I guess that's what they ask for (Gang)

Wait, yeah (Woo), Mula Gang (Yeah)
Woo, man (Yeah), Mula Gang
Yeah, yeah (Gang), Mula Gang (Woo)
Gang, yeah (Woo), Mula Gang2Embed
