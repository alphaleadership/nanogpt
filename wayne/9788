5 ContributorsRespect Lyrics
Funkflex, Big Kap, Cash Money

Even if I don't get no taller I'ma always be a C.M.B baller
Wanted for manslaughter, they call me quick drawer
Weezie two pistols, I bought me a revolver
A K and two missiles, look, I'm ready for war
But do you fell the same? Look, come swim in my water
Tangle wit' Lil Wayne, bruh, you must be retarda
Don't know bout my niggas, I'm a seventeen off ya
Runnin with guerrillas, life's group is my big brotha
Thugged out and ready and I'm just a lil' shorter
But gangsta like Joe Pesci get ready to cock it and let it
Cut a nigga like machetes, turn 'em to confetti (All gone)
They want it raw dog so give 'em all hair
Dressed up in camouflage, me Juve in a V12
Just duck tape the nigga, throw his body in the lake
I ain't like him anyway cause the nigga too fake

I take respect nigga (Ya playin' the wrong one)
I'll break ya neck nigga (Ya playin' wit' da wrong gun)
I use K's to wet niggas (I'm spraying da whole room)
Better watch you back nigga (Lil' one that's a wrap)
I take respect nigga (Ya playin' the wrong one)
I'll break ya neck nigga (Ya playin' wit' da wrong gun)
I use K's to wet niggas (I'm spraying da whole room)
Better watch you back nigga (Lil' one that's a wrap)
You might also like
My worries was to get paid and double my earn
Go at it don't be afraid, and just keep on burning
Don't let it go to my head and take care of my children
Stay outta all of that bullshit, and change my appearance
I fear no muthafucka, I'm a man, ya know
Ya want beef but I choose it with the calicoes
Magnolia my home, and it's gon' always be
You get a tresspassing charge when you fuckin' with me
And it won't be the police when it's bringing you down
It will be a whole bunch of niggas that's banging them rounds
Tearing it down, had that third ward uptown
Fuckin around, got a nigga stuck, what now?
We could do this shit, pursue this shit ya know
We knew this shit, went through this shit before
Blood thicker than water and that's all the time
You takes nothing from me cause I'm a war for mine

I take respect nigga (Ya playin' the wrong one)
I'll break ya neck nigga (Ya playin' wit' da wrong gun)
I use K's to wet niggas (I'm spraying da whole room)
Better watch you back nigga (Lil' one that's a wrap)
I take respect nigga (Ya playin' the wrong one)
I'll break ya neck nigga (Ya playin' wit' da wrong gun)
I use K's to wet niggas (I'm spraying da whole room)
Better watch you back nigga (Lil' one that's a wrap)
I play the game realer than the average killer on the streets
Ain't no way I could have a bitch nigga thinking I'm weak
I tote heat, so be prepared to release ya heard me (Ya heard me)
Play myself, she slipped and the busta served me (Uh-uh)
I rips it up, hit ya block, lift the bitch up
Tell me what else could I do besides down or get drowned
That's why when I'm off in drama I goes out
Come in ya house, click-clack in ya baby mama's mouth
That's what it's about if ya doubt that
In the projects with ya head chopped where ya found at, I did that
I'm a nigga that be squeezing the trigga at random
Nabbin' niggas we call ho busta's for ransom
They don't call they people up tell em I blast 'em
That's how it go in the game, fuckin' right I blast them
I'm a fool with that black .9, ayy
And I got a click that's full of soldiers, coming in that water behind me (No respect for ya bitch)

I take respect nigga (Ya playin' the wrong one)
I'll break ya neck nigga (Ya playin' wit' da wrong gun)
I use K's to wet niggas (I'm spraying da whole room)
Better watch you back nigga (Lil' one that's a wrap)
I take respect nigga (Ya playin' the wrong one)
I'll break ya neck nigga (Ya playin' wit' da wrong gun)
I use K's to wet niggas (I'm spraying da whole room)
Better watch you back nigga (Lil' one that's a wrap)
I take respect nigga (Ya playin' the wrong one)
I'll break ya neck nigga (Ya playin' wit' da wrong gun)
I use K's to wet niggas (I'm spraying da whole room)
Better watch you back nigga (Lil' one that's a wrap)
I take respect nigga (Ya playin' the wrong one)
I'll break ya neck nigga (Ya playin' wit' da wrong gun)
I use K's to wet niggas (I'm spraying da whole room)
Better watch you back nigga (Lil' one that's a wrap)Embed
