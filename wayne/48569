Hey, Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker

Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker
Ah-ah, ah, bitch, I'm Mack Maaaaine
Yeah

Damn! Look at Ms. Parker (Yeah)
On the side of the road, taking off her parka (Yeah)
Bending over under the hood, her car wouldn't start up (yeah)
Hold up, Ms. Parker (Errrr!), nigga bout to park, ugh
I parked my whip and proceeded to her car, ugh
I know I'm on beam, she done broke another part, ugh
She got that big ol' thing poking out so far
That my Ma couldn't be mad if she finally let my Pa fuck
She saw a nigga and was like, "Hey, Mack Maine
I saw you on the video with Lil Wayne and T-Pain
In the back of the armored truck, like, switching four lanes
Holl'ing out, 'Woosh!' boy, like money ain't a thang"
I gave her a jump, and we went to the spot
She was getting all hot, special treatment for the cock
Had her screaming out, "Pump harder and harder"
Call Chris Tucker—I done fucked Ms. Parker!
Ugh, hey Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker
When you gon' let a nigga fuck?
Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker
I'm talmbout...
Hey!Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker
When you gon' let a nigga fuck?
Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker
Ugh, ahh

Hey! Ms Parker, Parker
She throw that ass back and then she park it, park it
She handcuff a nigga like a sergeant, sergeant
Hit her with the dick and now, she stalking, stalking
Yeah, so I hit her wit the ruler
Frostbit Gudda, got ice like a cooler
I don't give a fuck, bitch, your man is a pooper
The two of us pass in the whip and chunk the deuce up
Ugh, got a loose butt, tight waist
Flat stomach, nice titties, cute feet, nice face
Yeah, she say she from the Tri-State
That don't really matter, I can fly you out to my state
Yeah, I can take you to the right place
Top floor, penthouse, balcony, my place
Yeah, make a nigga throw some dollars out
Then I holla out, "Hey, Ms. Parker"
Hey! Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker
When you gon' let a nigga fuck?
Ms. Parker, Miss....
Talking 'bout...
Hey! Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker
When you gon' let a nigga fuck?
Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker (Uh-huh)
Talking 'bout, hey! Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker (Woo-woo!)
When you gon' let a nigga fuck?
Ms. Park... Ms. Parker? (Woo-woo!)

I said girl, you got an ass on you...
I said, Ms. Parker, you got a ass on you... Oww! (Ayy)
I said when you gon' let me fuck?
Ayy, Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker
I said when you gon' let me fuck?
When you gon' let a nigga fuck?
When you gon' let me fuck?
Ayy, Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker
I said when you gon' let me fuck?
I said when you gon' let me fuck?
Ayy, Ms. Parker, Ms. Parker
I said when you gon' let me fuck?
Ms. Parker, when you gon' let a nigga fuck?
Somebody call Chris Tucker up, call Chris Tucker up

And tell him that I fucked Ms. Parker

Looking all fine and shit!
Like a nigga gon' keep passing you up
Speaking!
Fuck that!
I'm like, "Hey, Ms. Parker!
When you gon' let a nigga fuck?"
