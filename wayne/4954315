Yea - yea - yea

Whats really good? whats really good?
Huh ha check me out daddy
Remix...im weezy muhafucka
Young rich bastard

Or die in a blast - y
And i was born in a casket
In other words i was born na die - faget
Dont ask my why
And the SQAD's my crown family
Young Money shine like the skies of Miami - goddammit
This is not nas landed
No soap opera
Nigga you could git scoped and popped up
Gagged up - tied and roped and chopped up
Its young cosa nostra - nigga mob up
No hoaster - toaster leave my thighs cut
No joker - 'pproch us and git cha spine tuck
Dont provoke me nigga

Ill let nina deep throat you nigga
Yea - w - stupid focus nigga

We broke all ya streets ki' back
Me young humprey both guards
Of the streets heat back
Weezy f. nigga - we back blocka-blocka
Til ya chest - 2 shots - see ya men
Homie can't squeeze back
And we want alla tha ki's too be exact
Of tha muhafuckn mac - we in that
We in back of tha muhafucka 'Lac
Gittin strapped
Cut tha lights off tha park
We gon get out and walk - like that nigga
Then git in the whip and circle right back
Nigga only guns sprayin
No ones playin
You die at tha hand of a guy
The man of the SQAD
Transport through the land
With the sand in tha caaaar
Muhafucka god damn who you are
Im young wayne bitches hand in they panties and braaa
Muhafucka god damn he tha booay
And he the star
Got grammies and grams in they broad
You might also like
I walk through tha - meanest city the darkest streets
I spit ta tha meanest drops - the hardest beats
Ima young east new orleans beast
You can't tell me shit
I leave that ass where they can't smell ya prick
Ya smell me prick
Halla at the slim high yella dude
Brim low - all i see is the flow - im a mellow dude
SQ fellow
Pack metal tools by the belt
Bitch ya better move
It ain't a game pussy
You niggas lame rookies
Take you and yo lame cookie
Me and my gang run a train on you lame spoogie
I pull that burner out
Aim and squish it
Now ya muhafuckin brain is gushy
Call the caronan man
Hall him off in the caronan van
I never seen so much horror in a man
Gudda Gudda nigga

Its mister, serety walk and do as he wish
T - spray that pump and shoot that bitch
Gun - set it off nigga blue as my wrist
Platinum boys and blue can do about this
You as my bitch
True self - SQ is the shit
Gives you too admit the same beautiful shit
Pussy - lemme pinch ya pearl
You soft bullets go through you and hit cha girl
Damn and i ain't even try ta hit cha girl
Cuz im prolly couldn't hit cha girl
Damn - and its tha boy, back again
Use slang in my rap
And i rap is slang
Strap - pap-pap at cha captain
Yall better adapt ta what tha fuck is bout ta happen
Make a mac
Take a crap on ya napkin
Now wipe that mug off ya face and quit actin you faget
Im a 9th ward nigga
With my nuts in my hand
But behind both of my ears
Puttin one in tha air
Gun on both sides of my ribs
Feelin lucky my man
Feel im bluffin complain
Into one of im sprayin
Lil boy im a young money man
Talkn bout hundred grands in rubber brands
Pullin down my fuckin pants nigga
You a bitch im pullin down ya fuckn plans
And yo bitch pullin down my fuckin pants nigga
And iont like i despite niggas like you
I got a knife on my riffle
Ill snipe you then slice you
So get up off tha matrix boy
Fore yo mami fillin out visitation forms - man
My name is known for breakin in homes
Or bein in white folk crib like gre' poupon
Ill take the grey in chrome - or safety on
A vest can't barricade ya dome nigga

Yea muhafucka its Raw Diculous

So rugged im tuckin a .4 fuzzy
And duckin them fozy
Comin my buddy its young money - fuckaEmbed
