2 ContributorsKilling Me Lyrics
Woo
Yeah
How y'all doing out there?
I just  my story
You dig?
That's right
Everybody in the crowd put your 3s up
There, 3s up, let's go

Yeah
3 in the morning, I ain't home yet
Shorty blowing up my phone like a bomb treat
What's going on baby? Why you moan that?
Knowing when I make it home I'll get your thong wet
Okay I'm on my way, speed and windows up
So have my food warm, and have my pillars fluffed
She been through the water, shorty pillow tuff
Shorty took all of the shots like the little cough
I wanna give her all, and never give her up
I told her when it die down, we can live it up
Where would you be? Be without me
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like

Yeah, I'm like
As soon as I come home, I was working long
She wanna know what I was working on
So I played the song, and I make her feel wrong
But stealing all in my eyes , she pass right
I can't trip, cause no one loves the fast life when sitting in the passenger sit
 tight, and she  a whole  to me, a whole 
But for me that's too much to eat, in one bite, but
Imma chew and just do what I gotta, other bitches get the  like a hot top prada
Where would you be? Be without me
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like
You might also like
Can I talk to her?
Yeah
Um

Be the drama on day town television
What is this, detention? It feel like elementary
I wish I never end you, or I scar you
When I think bout my future, baby that all you
I mean that is you, part of my vision though
Part of my mental, see what I'm into?
See how I'm in-to deep in the shit too?
It ain't just you, it is us too
I trust you, you gotta trust me
Cause in them other bitches eyes, I'm a "must-see"
Now where would you be? Be without me
Don't doubt me be about me girlEmbed
