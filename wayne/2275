17 ContributorsIntro LyricsRasta dem king of the jungle
Dread lock swing down me back like Repunzel
My bred'dren sling dem pack an' dem bundle
We'll take your tings, sell it back to your uncle
And we'll make it rain till your dances will come true
We'll make it rain so you betta bring a swimsuit
Alone when I came, but I'm leavin with them two
Gals give me brain, give me brain like temples
And him got the game, game sharp like a pencil
And if you want formage we can crash like a symbol
And Let prepare me window, on my new sports coupe
Twelve hoarses in the hood, sittin on hoarse shoes
Come from the land that Jesus walked through
Sacrifice me life, man I bleed for me uncle
Them no want to run, run with me them no want to
Murder them, and the family them belong to
Next ting them kno I run a street like a car door
You go after me, me I dearly depart you
Hip hop is mine now, Mine what you gone do?
I can jump on any nigga song and make a part two
Playtime for me, cuz see to me, they are cartoons
How come every joint be on point like a harpoon?
How come evry bar stand strong like a barstool?
How come every line is so raw you gone snort too?
Murder them. Man I murda them. Fuck a competition, man I murda them
Man murda them. Man I murda them. Fuck a competition, man I murda them
And that is why I'm hot
Its Da Drought 3, Welcome
Have fun!You might also like3Embed
