1 ContributorBill Gates Freestyle Lyrics
What's happenin' people?
Diz ya boy E-Dolla man, I'm chillin' wit my boy Sir C. Y. 
We bout to act a fool and crank dis beat up, so let's get it...

All these bitches, these niggas hatin'
Figure 8 ice on, watch a nigga skatin'
Hold up what you thinkin'?, cause we ridin' on them 8 in.'s
Naw, I'm talkin' Daytons
No flood on Miami nigga
They talkin' bout I might just spark him, hit him in his mouth
Shh.., whatchu talkin' bout? Y'all niggas ain't sparkin' out
Kill his ass dead on the beat, now I chalk it out
Walk it out like DJ Unk, hold up whatchu sayin'? Uh
Put some umph in it, then I bump it up
Boom boom baby, in'n'out the block
Thump on rabbit fucks 
Y'all niggas is just schmucks, I'm just grape jelly purple
Leafy green, eyes blooded
Too much swag, steppin' on yo scene... Hah

Y'all niggas hatin' (Yeah)
Pull up on him then I start cuttin' thru his swag man (Yeah)
I'm that Swag Man (Yeah), you just not at, top like the attic... (Thе attic..)

Eenie meenie minеy mo
I am the pimp nigga and yo bitch is my hoe (Ooh)
You steady talkin' nigga but I pay him no attention (Uh-uh)
Money on my mind, that's my number one mission
And like a kangaroo, I hop off in that pussy
And you know what it is, I love it when it's wet and gushy
So come on over here girl, and let me rock your world
Call me Jheri, girl, cause I'll make ya toes curl
That boy so serious, I'm so hood
Look into my eyes, nigga, I ain't up to no good
East Side GA, yes I keep an AK
Fuck around, best believe I'll let that fucking shit spray
Yes indeed, my eyes so big
I'm dreamin' bout the money, cause that is the shit
M-O-N-E-Y, money money on my mind
And you know what it is
G-I-R-N-D, GRINDEmbed
