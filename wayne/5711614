Uhhhhhhh!
Money by the ton
Bricks from crumbs
Billionaire from nothin
Mind on hustlin
Pussy's a commodity
But dicks sell better
Went from Dickies and house shoes to a cashmere sweater
Paint that got wetter than it was in nine four
The drank that got thicker and the dirt weed dro
Nine six Impala with the stick on the floor
Nice Bentley, four doors, with madrona on the door
Light wood nigga, polo fuck 
 Slim Thug
 full of drugs
Young hog, nigga
Underdog, nigga
, pussy nigga
Yellow diamonds on my finger
Playin in the cock
My dick wanna fuck but my pockets say stop
Not cuz they empty I’m just greedy for some more
I need some more dough I'ma P-I-M-P fo sho

That's my lingo
You gon always see me with cash like Tango
That nigga Pimp called me 'fore he left this bitch
Told me keep doin ya thing and don't tell 50 shit
South in ya mouth
New Orleans hog
Got a New Orleans gun and I shoot like Chris Paul
I am Mr. Go Hard
You boys just soft
And everybody know what I drink so a nigga never cough
And a niggas never snitch like a nigga never golf
And a nigga forever rich
But pussy will never cost
Because a nigga forever pimp
Cuz we were rather taught
By a nigga named Pimp and Bun B from Port Art
So, this is simply game, man, this is no art
And, Stunna is my Pa and ain't shit that he ain't bought
And, I'ma do the same so everything on Wayne and
If we talkin money you should let me explain
Haha- Young Mula, baby
