I admit it (I admit it)
I was wrong but I had to get it (Had to get it)
Ain't finna be working no job that pay $7.50 (Add it up)
More like seven figures (Figures)
My dream was to be a rich nigga (Rich nigga)
Studio in the basement ticking (Ticking)
Young niggas pulling them triggers

Why you mad at me 'cause my bills paid?
I put lean in my lemonade
Throw the lunch money in the third grade
I told my teacher we could shoot the fade
My bitch roll with me like cascade
In jail I learned to play the spades
Now I wake up and I got a maid
So many games I ain't never played
Thеse rappers roaches, need somе fuckin' Raid
Don't need an Uber, got an Escalade
Stacking money, I been living great
She fuck me so good that I woke up late
I admit I was hustling til I went legit
Ran off on the plug, I gave him counterfeit

I admit it (I admit it)
I was wrong but I had to get it (Had to get it)
Ain't finna be working no job that pay $7.50 (Add it up)
More like seven figures (Figures)
My dream was to be a rich nigga (Rich nigga)
Studio in the basement ticking (Ticking)
Young niggas pulling them triggers

I admit it, you done me wrong but I'm glad you did it, yeah
Could've got you back but I got back to business, bitch, ooh
You know I'm a god, you gotta act religious, bitch
Had to cut you off and give your ass the scissors, bitch, ooh
I like my bitch new, yeah
Let me flick my hair back, uh
Ravishing Rick Rude, yeah
I used to stare at her cat, I tell that shit "ruff"
She catching flashbacks, that what that dick do
But I admit it, I was fucked up
But I ain't trippin', I kept it one hundred
The dumbest bitches have dumb luck
But when shit got sticky, I ain't get stuck
And with all I was given, I ain't give up
Thought I was living, I ain't live enough
I had to cut your ass out the picture
So I took your picture and I cut it up

I admit it (I admit it)
I was wrong but I had to get it (Had to get it)
Ain't finna be working no job that pay $7.50 (Add it up) (I admit it)
More like seven figures (Figures) (Yeah)
My dream was to be a rich nigga (Rich nigga)
Studio in the basement ticking (Ticking) (Yeah)
Young niggas pulling them triggers
I admit it, you done me wrong but I'm glad you did it, yeah
Could've got you back but I got back to business, bitch, ooh
You know I'm a god, you gotta act religious, bitch, ooh
Had to cut you off and give your ass the scissors, bitch, ooh
I like my bitch new, she like my bitch too
And she gon' like Rich too
Trust fund, yeah
I like my bitches new
But I admit it I was fucked up
I admit I'm a trust fund, baby1Embed
