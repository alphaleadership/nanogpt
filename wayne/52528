Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop itâ€”

Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl
Drop it, drop it low, girl (Ayy), drop it, drop it low, girl (Ayy)
Drop it, drop it low, girl (Ayy), drop it, drop it low, girl (Ayy, ayy)
Drop it, drop it low, girl (Ayy), drop it, drop it low, girl (Ayy)
Drop it, drop it low, girl (Ayy), drop it, drop it low, girl (Ayy, ayy)
Drop it, drop it

Ah-hem, if your ass too big, I make ya back that ass up
I only go down if you keep your grass cut
Hair to the back, hat to the front
Weezy F. baby, tatted on the butt
Okay, still remixin' with one of these vixens
I make her ride me like I'm Sea Biscuit
Ms. Ester Dean, you can get it
Look, I like a nice two-pack and a booty on biggie
What's really good? What you know about it?
Swagger too good, I should notarize it
Yeah, they call me Tune, no Bugs Bunny
Make the booty clap, give it up for me
Yeah, it's Young Money, you know I bring money
I make that booty talk, Connie Chung for me
I got her butt naked in a red Snuggie
I make her drop it low like she duckin' from me
Now where she at? (Ayy) Where she at? (Ayy)
There she go (Ayy), there she go (Ayy)
She bring it back (Ayy), br-bring it back (Ayy)
Then she drop it low (Ayy), drop it low, ya dig

Wanna pop it, pop it, pop it, sweep that ass on the floor
You wanna see me shake it, shake it, shake it

Oh, yeah, boy, you like that
