20 ContributorsWockesha (Remix) Lyrics
Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute, but, um
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business
What's in my cup, what's in your cup
What's in their cup, it's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup
The only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Did a lot more things that I've ever done
I probably should pick that cup back up

First thing first, Perc' popper, drink always muddy
Flooded, crushed ice in the cup, it look diamond studded
Slushy, fuckin' codeine raw, but I ain't bussin'
Throw her in the drink, she throw me in park, and I ain't budgin'
Ooh, some say the lean makes the drink seem spectacular
Wockesha ain't no Activis but she can act like hеr
Shiverin', I'm leanin', pivotin'
Chill, relax, finе, let me pour up a line
Ring, ring around the rosey, leanin' got me dozing
Wrap her body up in two cups, keep her cozy
Fire, I'm blowing like King Koopa, Yoshi
Murder she wrote me with a purple emoji, yeah
The days are just colder without her
Without that purple, I'm blue, the Lakers just golden without her
I don't go nowhere without her, hide in my soda, Osama
When it come to that Wocka', I got that hoe by the flocka, 'Kesha
You might also like
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya, pourin' O's in a liter
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup

I'm sittin' here lookin' at 'Kesha, like, "Do you love me, do you love me not?"
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and then I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she mine (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat (That's hot)
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie, you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearin' 'em on my sleeve (See)
Baby, why you hurt me? Leave me and desert me
Boy, I gave you all my heart and all you did was tear it up
Lookin' out my window, knowin' that I should go (I should go)
Even when I pack my bags
There's something always holdin' me back (Ashanti)
I ain't with the runnin' back, you can keep your money bag
You be tryna trick on me, sip on me 'cause you want it back
Babe, don't play with my heart babe
I been in it with you from the start, ayy
Ain't nobody there like I'm there for you to lean on
Double cup love both got each other fiendin' (Fiendin')
Hey, you better change yo habits
Uh, 'cause boy, you fuckin' with a classic

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup but ain't no truth in that
They be like I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya, pouring O's in a liter
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)
Without you
No more, no more6Embed
