Yeah, I don't even know what that bitch saying
But I don't know what most of these bitches be saying anyway
Most of these bitches don't know what the fuck they be saying
It's not even light out
Yeah, let's go

Uh, I break the leg off a bitch
And kick her in the ass with her own shit
I'm getting tired of my own dick
'Cause it keep me up all fucking day and fucking night
Just fucking all fucking day and fucking night
I can't believe this butter, butt-fuck a butter knife
My dick get hard when thunder strike
I need help, I need a light
I know they gonna cross me, if they crossed Jesus Christ
I cross my heart, hope to die
Met a bitch that was rich who never seen roaches fly
I took her to the South side, left her ass outside
Legs open mouth wide
I get high like them niggas on that movie "How High"
Or maybe higher
Christians die or live in fear
I hope new rappers disappear
But I ain't worried 'cause they will in a year, haha
It's not even light out
You appear to be a queer
I leave you in a swamp crying crocodile tears, haha
As the crowd cheers, thank you
I thank God every day because I ain't you, haha
You might also like
But you've somewhere to be
I'ma let that bitch sing
No hesitation
No, I've never seen you like this
And I don't like it
I don't like it
But she's always talking to me Lord
I don't like it
I don't like it
I don't like it at all
Shit, you still ain't finished?
I don't like it

Alright, kiss me on my bullet wound
Before I jump the broom, I'd rather jump over the fucking moon
Your girl just told my girl she wanna lick what's in my underoos
And every time I tell her "Leave," she hate to go like summer school
I spit, I vomit, I pukes, I shits, I number twos
I makes money, makes moves and make fun of you
I jump off her clit and I land on her face
I squeeze on her tits 'til her implants deflate
Bet I jump off some shit and I land on my skate... board
If life is a bitch, mine is Betty... Ford
They tried to make me go to rehab
Rest in peace Amy Winehouse
I hope I sign your autograph before I sign out
Merlot color flag with my 9 out
It's not even light out
I cock and shoot, look like I'm calling time-out
But I'm not
But you've somewhere to be
I just shoot her
No hesitation
Pow
No, I've never seen you like this
Pow
And I don't like it
I don't like it
I don't like it
She don't like it
I don't like it at all
She know she like it

Shanell just walked in
They find your head sticking out the water like a shark fin
When I was young, I used to cry because I had dark skin
Martin Luther King gon' slap the shit out me when I die, man
I can make any bitch shit in my hand
And mush it in your face like a pie pan
I used to fuck your girl, but that pussy feel like dry land
Smoking on that good make me look like I'm from Thailand
Fuck y'all niggas, not literally
My girl from Italy
But fuck that shit, I'll make your bitch swallow my little me's
I make the healthiest motherfucker sick of me
Them hoes wanna have my baby like Billie Jean
But beat it
Get it? Jack it off, beat it, psh-haha
It's not even light out
Yeah, that dry pussy tastes better when it's bleeding
Now tweet it, psh
I can't believe I said "Tweet" in a rap
But you've somewhere to be
I thought I'd never say that
Fuck, I hate this song
No hesitation
I don't like it
No, I've never seen you like this
And I don't like it, I don't like it
I don't like it at all
Psh-haha Mr. Beatz on the track6Embed
