Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I'm not sorry, but I lied
It feel a little bit better when you close your eyes, cl-close your eyes
Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I know you hate me 'cause I'm right
Just close your eyes, this is my
M-m-m-my lullaby-by-by-by-by

(Hush, hush)
Uh, I tell her I'm workin', I'm not with these hoes
Yeah, she say, "You better be workin' and not with these hoes" (Hush, hush)
I tell her what she wanna hear, not what she don't wanna know
She tell me, "Be quiet and ride me slow, like they got bumps in the road" (Hush, hush)
Look, what you don't know won't hurt your ass
Girl, 'cause if you knew better, you'd do better, yeah, whatever, shit (Hush, hush)
I tell you "I'm here" when I'm there and "I don't" when I do
And you just want me to tell all of the bitches I care for it's all about you

And I get that, so when I'm with them, I just hit that
I don't even kiss back, my white lies are pitch black, believe that
And I ain't proud of myself, I can't lie to myself
I said, "Self, gather yourself," and left her cryin' by herself, whoa

Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I'm not sorry, but I lied
It feel a bit better when you close your eyes, cl-close your eyes
Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I know you hate me 'cause I'm right
Just close your eyes, this is my (You met me this way, baby)
M-m-m-my lullaby

(Hush, hush)
Uh, I tell her, "Don't worry, it's not 'bout them hoes"
She just be hopin' whenever I'm worried, it's not  'bout them hoes (Hush, hush)
Uh, she act like my stories are not gettin' old
But I know she'd rather hear what I tell her, not what she not bein' told (Hush, hush)
Okay, I lied to you 'cause the truth hurts
And it hurts me too, I would cry with you but I gotta work, I gotta work (Hush, hush)
She say, "You better be workin' and not with these hoes"
But I drive 'em so crazy like I got the wheel on the wide-open road

And I zig-zag, and when I'm with them, I just hit that
We don't even kickback, chit-chat, nor chillax, believe that
And I ain't proud of that shit, I can't lie about that shit
I say, "Self, snap out this shit," and left her crying 'bout that shit, woah
Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I'm not sorry, but I lied
It feel a bit better when you close your eyes, cl-close your eyes
Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I know you hate me 'cause I'm right
Just close your eyes, this is my
