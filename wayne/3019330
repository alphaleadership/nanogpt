We got Cash Money on the table and underneath the floor

It's Dipset, bitch

Weezy baby 80's baby
Back when heroin was crazy baby

Okay we gon' do it like this
We back again
Santana

I'm the sickest nigga doing it, bet that baby
These other niggas dope, I'm wet crack baby

And I ain't talkin' bout Lindsay Lohan
I'm talking bout that sniff that blow man

I Can't Feel My Face featuring Juelz Santana
