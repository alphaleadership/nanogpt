1 ContributorImpossible Lyrics
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my libra scale, I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
So on my libra scale, I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around, like a hula
Karma, karma is a bitch
Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful

Yeah I'ma keep it real, let it out in the air
Do your smoke stand over your head?
That's how you know the end is near, there
How I was to know it all
Hell must have never around
Silly me for thinking I could have changed you
A liar stays that way and over now
Seeing you for who you really are
But you don't care about no onе but yourself
They told me not to takе a chance on you
Well silly me for thinking I could have changed
The way you play the game and the way you treat a lady
I should have known, from all the signs and all the talk, that

You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
Tell me is it possible
You might also like
For you to get out of my face
And it's just that bad, and I ain't got time
For a nigga like you, so go ahead and get gone
I broke it down for the last time
Then I'm still around, that I'm still around
(You're impossible)

It gets to the point, that I don't really care what you say
You're literally unbelievable
And it looks like you gonna stay that way, yeah
So what you think I wanna hear
You tell me you love me, you love no one else
Boy you got me messed up
Using me to suck upon a shelf
But I forgive you, I forgive you baby
Yeah it's my lesson learned, and they were going crazy
I tried to make it work steady acting shady
But I can't change you, that's who you are
Yeah, right from the start
I should have known, all the signs and all the the talk, that

You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
Tell me is it possible
For you to get out of my face
And it's just that bad, and I ain't got time
For a nigga like you, so go ahead and get gone
I broke it down for the last time
Then I'm still around, that I'm still around
(You're impossible)

I wish there was more to say
But I ain't got nothing baby
One foot out the door, I ain't looking back to see you
If there's another chance for us
There's no need to apologize
'Cause you are who you are
I'm just hoping that you realize

You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
You are so impossible
Niggas is jealous, niggas is jealous
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with them apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my libra scale, I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
So on my libra scale, I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma, karma is a bitch
Well just make sure that bitch is beautifulEmbed
