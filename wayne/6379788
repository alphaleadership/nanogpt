15 ContributorsBig Boss Lyrics
Big dog, yeah

Now I bet she get a Birkin if I make her mad (Bitch)
(Hurt, what it do?)
Now I’m rich, I stuff a hundred in the trash bag (Rich)
Free my niggas, put that on my mama and my dad
Fucked her once, she say I’m the best she ever had (Bloublood, know what I'm sayin'?)
I’m a big boss, fuck her then I make her get lost
Cross ya out like criss cross
Buck fifty what my wrist cost
Just one call, we gon’ knock em’ off
Bought a crib, look at the loft
Bad bitch and the ass too soft
On the drank, I might doze off (Big boss)

I don’t need no friends
Maybach drop a truck, I preorder a Benz
That’s yo’ baby mama? Knock her right down like a bowling pin
Got a hundred bands on me right now and an F&N (Right now)
Just started, I ain't finish yet
Left the quarantinе with a bigger check
Made four mill's just to bе correct
Had to buy a Patek, put it on yo' neck
Or I mean put it on yo' head
If they fuck with ya'll they gone end up dead
Beam on 'em and it might be red
Ain't kill a nigga, fucked his bitch instead
Bottega, I'ma addict
I just met the bitch last night, she call me daddy
Fucked her in the, Caddy
Call herself a baddie
Send her fifty thousand in an Uber, what's the, addy? (I'm rich)

Now I bet she get a Birkin if I make her mad
Now I’m rich, I stuff a hundred in the trash bag (Rich)
Free my niggas, put that on my mama and my dad
Fucked her once, she say I’m the best she ever had
I’m a big boss, fuck her then I make her get lost
Cross ya out like criss cross
Buck fifty what my wrist cost
Just one call, we gon’ knock em’ off
Bought a crib, look at the loft
Bad bitch and the ass too soft
On the drank, I might doze off (Big boss)

But don't sleep
I might not hear my phone beep
I’m at home on the gas, I call you when I’m on E
I’m  home countin’ money
I lose my count, I'm gon' freak
Bought a house the other day and gave all my thots they own key
I do it bigger than bosses
With all these sticks', we golfin'
With all this drip, it's a faucet
Turn all the pictures to portraits
Got too rich, I'm a target
My mama wish I would bargain
But I walk it like I talk it
Money talkin', they arguin'
I put my trust into funds
Make her dust off the ones
I drop some Tuss in my punch, then drop some nuts on her gums
Chuck the deuce up but to her that's just a couple of ones
When she get pissed, I ice her wrist and make her fuck with some gloves
I love her
Now I bet she get a Birkin if I make her mad (Yeah)
Now I’m rich, I stuff a hundred in the trash bag (Rich) (Yeah, yeah)
Free my niggas, put that on my mama and my dad
Fucked her once, she say I’m the best she ever had
I’m a big boss, fuck her then I make her get lost
Cross ya out like criss cross
Buck fifty what my wrist cost
Just one call, we gon’ knock em’ off (Yeah, yeah)
Bought a crib, moved out at the loft
Bad bitch and the ass too soft
On the drank, I might doze off

But don't sleep
I might not hear my phone beep
I’m at home on the gas, I call you when I’m on E
I’m at home countin’ money
I lose my count, I'm gon' freak
Bought a house the other day and gave all my thots they own key1Embed
