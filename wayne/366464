7 ContributorsGet Out Lyrics
Yeah, please Don't Be Alarmed
By The Far Footsteps You Hear
Coming Up From The Rear
It's Only A One Man Army
Carter, Me, That's Who
Eh, John Just Let Me Rock Man
Let's Go

Hot damn ya'll snakes left me in the desert to swell
Don't forget you niggas met me in the desert I yell
No one can hear me so come get me out the desert, so
I just stay hot, and blaze what I got
Turn up the temperture burn up the tension
These wheels is perpendicular 24 inches
Got dammit man when my rubberband tires stop
I bounce back like rubberband and slingshot to the top, Fucker
You might see me in a tire shop
I am letting ya'll know that I'ma ride it out
I'm living in cash money never Dying out
You can't pull me to the side you can't buy me out
So make good with the mobb niggas squad it out
I'ma G, I'ma die with the llama out
So make good with the boy niggas squad it out
I'ma G nigga how I get out remember that bitch

I Get Out Before Your Boxes

Sweetheart I get out I promise you
You can't hold me in these chambers

They can't hold me rabbit you made me
I get out before your boxes

You can't hold me in these chamber
Nene I got us Zietha I got us
Me that's who

I learned so much and grown so little
In my physical not including my dick and my genitals
And I pop at you to confirm my criminal
One chief tribe I'm head Seminole
Carter's straight
I then ran through the Florida State
I got money, drugs, hoes in every part of the state
My Miami hideaway ocean view will catch you
I bring sand to the beach and still build a castle, nigga
You turn hoes off I take those on
A magnum latex goes on the pace goes on
I take a bitch to a island you take a ho to the mall
I holler once and shake a ho to the alphasician
I gotta gun I keep with me under all conditions
Cause I'ma entertainer slash small physician
Kordell Stewart in ball conditions
I come to ya'll town and brawl under ya'll conditions
I get out
I Get Out
Bitch
I get out before your boxes
I get out
I'm and all around player man
You can't hold me in these chambers
I get out
They can't hold me baby mami
I get out before your boxes
I get out
No

1,2,3,4,5 in the hand of that man with the all black tee
Icey white sneaks ice is bright over the same black tee
I sit down at night over cheese cake and black tea
And don't think I just think it
Hit a track and I stink it
You ain't met a nigga like me in while my type extinct, bitch
That's like Noah with no arc
They calling my thoughts the Maxwell house so dark
Step up on the mound with no bark
Pedro Martinez with my mean ass
No matter how old a nigga
I Peter Rolle a nigga
I Fish Pole a nigga
I beat a hole in a nigga
Either holding a pistol or I'm holding a gun
You rolling with me?
Niggas is fraud I got the exposure with me
Yeah niggas is broads ho in they features
And a war paint script in my face to let em' know I'ma creature
I get out
I get out
Pay attention bitch
I get out before your boxes
I get out
I promise
You can't hold me in these chambers
I get out
Nigga Me that's who
I get out before your boxes
I get out
Who else is there to blame
You can't hold me in these chambers

Niggas made it cause I'm real
(That's What's up)
Remember that
(Shit Test Me)
It ain't a gang
Without a gangster in front of that
(Fucker)
I Play ThatEmbed
