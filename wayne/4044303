8 ContributorsNew Level (Original) Lyrics
My bed, my bed
Somebody's takin' my place (Right Now)
Yeah, yeah, baby
Hitmaka

Tryna put you on that level, another level
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh yeah)
You know you could do much better (Do)
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh, oh)

You've been so incomplete
You've been fell in too deep
Wish I could read your mind
And stop wasting my time

Tryna put you on that level, another level
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh yeah)
You know you could do much better (Do)
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh, oh)
Tryna put you on that level (Another level)
Tryna put you on that level (Oh yeah)
You know you could do much better (Oh, oh)
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh, oh)

Ice up on the check the bezel
Yeah, rocky, rocky, fruity pebble
Do you realize this is what you've got?
Don't tell me you second guessin' now

You've been so incomplete
You've been fell in too deep (Too deep)
Wish I could read your mind (Read your mind)
And stop wasting my time

Tryna put you on that level, another level (On that level)
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh yeah)
You know you could do much better (Do, oh)
I'm tryna put you on that level (On that level, oh, oh, on that)
Tryna put you on that level, another level (On, on that)
Tryna put you on that level (Oh, oh yeah)
You know you could do much better (Do, oh)
I'm tryna put you on that level (Oh, oh)

Tryna put you on my level, put you on my schedule
Put you on my dresser, you should leave that fella
You should cross over, hit him with the hesi
Then what you just tell 'em is, he could keep the pet
Just because he fat, when he send the message
You should hit the edit, you should wear the teddy
Everybody knows it's level to this shit, but he don't even smell 'em
You was sent from Heaven, sleepin' with the devil
Leave him in the desert, come to warm weather
No more stormy weather, I ain't got umbrellas
I got palms and the trees even wetter
Oops, I mean better he said you would never leave
Never say never say never, he should cut it out
You should cut him off, scissor hand, baby I could call Edward (brrr)
Tryna put you on that level, another level (put you on that level)
I'm tryna put you on that level (oh yeah, ooh)
You know you could do much better (do, oh)
I'm tryna put you on that level (on that level, oh, on that)
Tryna put you on that level, another level (on, on that)
Tryna put you on that level (oh yeah)
You know you could do much better (do, oh)
I'm tryna put you on that level (oh, oh)2Embed
