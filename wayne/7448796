1 ContributorRide 4 Me Lyrics
(This is Fear Factor Music you muthafuckers)
Uh
(Southern Smoke)
(Turn the fuckin' beat up)
(Yeah, baby!)
I grew up in the hood where the only job niggas had was standing on the corner (Bitch, I'm Mack Maine!)
I grew up in the hood where the only job niggas had was standing on the corner (Southern Smoke)
I grew up in the hood where the only job niggas had was standing on the corner
Raised with no fathers, stole from they sisters and they brothers
And they even sold crack to they mamas (They mamas)

Ain't no nigga gon' ride for me, like my niggas gon' ride for me (Yeah)
I said "ain't no nigga gon' ride for me, like my niggas gon' ride for me"
Now, if you want beef muthafucker, come get it
If you gassed up then I know it's unleaded
If you feel played and ain't about it then don't sweat it (Shit)
Stop co-signing for niggas with bad credit (Credit)

Well...
I'm an M-A-C on the M-I-C the H-I-N-C, y'all niggas gon' see
I'm from the UPT, so from my D.O.B. until I R.I.P
I ain't nun' but a G
I feel like P-A-C 'cause I'm an outlaw
Plus I'm ready to die just like B-I-G
Shit, think it's a game, ask Baby and Slim where I came
Like, hook me up, I ain't got no time for no game, shit
But a, rat-ti-tat-tat-ti-tat, on you dog hoes
But a, rat-ti-tat-tat-ti-ti, on you dog hoes
I'm 'bout to go and cop a V, on you dog hoes
Y'all better ask who I be, on you dog hoes (Mack Maine!)
Oh yes indeed, I'm from the H double O-D
Still puffin' on that fuckin' G double O-D
Still run with a few niggas that might OD
Still keep that torture on the low like I'm low key
You might also like
Ain't no nigga gon' ride for me, like my niggas gon' ride for me (Yeah)
I said "ain't no nigga gon' ride for me, like my niggas gon' ride for me"
Now, if you want beef muthafucker, come get it
If you gassed up then I know it's unleaded
If you feel played and ain't about it then don't sweat it
Stop co-signing for niggas with bad credit (Credit)

Um, my street is Apple and Eagle, my hood is Hollygrove (Cyeah)

I keep it true (Cyeah), Young Money my nigga so fuck you
What's new? Young Money them niggas, we get loot, get you
Weezy like "what your bitch do?"

The infrared on the pistol peek-a-boo, I see you (Get 'em)
I see you Mack; that's my nigga, hold (Mack)

And we both from the 17th ward
And we get crazy like a fucking retard
You can plugged like you getting recharged
Real dreadlock man'll rock but fuck boy
Tuk-tuk-paca, say paca who want more? (Yeow)
Made New Orleans to the core! (Yeah)
Ain't no nigga gon' ride for me, like my niggas gon' ride for me (Yeah)
I said "ain't no nigga gon' ride for me, like my niggas gon' ride for me"
Now, if you want beef muthafucker, come get it

Holly Grove wassup, 17th wassup, Uptown wassup, New Orleans wassup, Cash Money wassup, Young Money wassup, Real Niggas wassup, wassup, wassup (Cyeah)

New Orleans my city, Uptown be my home, baby
My homies be wildin', we need a check, we all crazy
But, let me tell you a little something 'bout me
I'm a mack like Rufus, sick with it like Cleet
I get low like Jaggen and mix your face like T
But I never make a beat, capische? Ha ha
Ounces of slap is good but with a 
Nigga, this is the murda capitol, where niggas murder happen

Ain't no nigga gon' ride for me, like my niggas gon' ride for me (Yeah)
I said "ain't no nigga gon' ride for me, like my niggas gon' ride for me"
Now, if you want beef muthafucker, come get it
If you gassed up then I know it's unleaded
If you feel played and ain't about it then don't sweat it
Stop co-signing for niggas with bad credit (Credit)
Holly Grove wassup, 17th wassup, Uptown wassup, New Orleans wassup, Cash Money wassup, Young Money wassup, Real Niggas wassup, wassup, wassup (Cyeah)

(Southern Smoke)
And that was another banger as usual
No pen, no pad
And the drugs wasn't, wasn't even present that night
That's the sober free, ya'll know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
But anyway...Embed
