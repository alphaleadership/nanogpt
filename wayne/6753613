35 ContributorsSTUNNAMAN Lyrics
Woo-woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo, woo
Woo-woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo, woo (D-Roc)

I bought a white Bentayga
Had to creep through the night in the spaceship
We was runnin' outside from the jakes
Now I put a lot of ice in the face, huh
Keep a lot of shooters in the cut-cut
And I got a ride with the tuck-up, huh
Gave a hundred racks to my brother, huh
Pop out a check, I'ma fuck up, huh
And I got the whole hood on go
Look at my neck, my wrist, my pinky on froze
Stunnaman, stunnaman, stunnaman, drip-drip down to my toes
Still pull up in a Rolls-Rolls

Got a Ferrari when I drive through the hills
All of my niggas outside for real
I'm 'bout to shit on niggas, diarrhea
It's a lot of fake niggas, I'ma die real
I be hanging outside with guerillas
Lost my dawg, wanna die with my niggas
Niggas rather be fly than realer
And if the opps wanna slide, get hit up
I'm in the gang for the dirty-dirty
My right hand keep a .30 clip
I done did some time with the murderers
I ain't gotta shine on purpose, huh
Platinum every time I put out (Put out)
Trap house lookin' like a cookout (Cookout)
He creepin' up, get the red dot, headshot
You might also like
I bought a white Bentayga
Had to creep through the night in the spaceship
We was runnin' outside from the jakes
Now I put a lot of ice in the face, huh
Keep a lot of shooters in the cut-cut
And I got a ride with the tuck-up, huh
Gave a hundred racks to my brother, huh
Pop out a check, I'ma fuck up, huh
And I got the whole hood on go
Look at my neck, my wrist, my pinky on froze
Stunnaman, stunnaman, stunnaman, drip-drip down to my toes (Stunna)
Still pull up in a Rolls-Rolls (Rich Gang)

Cap a slingshot on eighty shit, cherry wood in all my whips
Do it big, that label shit
Created shit but stayed hood rich (Stayed rich)
That's how we lace this shit, get money, stay break a bitch
At the top of hill, another shootout
With a hundred mil', we weighed that shit (We weighed that shit)
Chanel bag, jewelries be hundred or mo' (Hundreds or mo')
And I got my whole hood on go (Hood on go)
Bird call, I hit a lace then got ghost (Got ghost)
Rich nigga, Roberto Cavalli, marble floors
I bought a white Bentayga
Had to creep through the night in the spaceship
(Blatt)
We was runnin' outside from the jakes
Now I put a lot of ice in the face, huh
Keep a lot of shooters in the cut-cut
And I got a ride with the tuck-up, huh
Gave a hundred racks to my brother, huh
Pop out a check, I'ma fuck up, huh
And I got the whole hood on go (Yeah)
Look at my neck, my wrist, my pinky on froze (Yeah, yeah)
Stunnaman, stunnaman, stunnaman, drip-drip down to my toes (Down to my toes)
Still pull up in a Rolls-Rolls (Uh)

Stunnaman, stunnaman, bulletproof Cullinan
Chrome Heart bust down, I weigh it underhand
Spent a couple hunnid bands, that was just for the band
Put a dirty hundred grand up in the laundry bag
'Bout to pop another Xan', 'bout to smoke a hundred grams
I'ma be who I am, you are not what I am
Lit like the light at the end of the tunnel, man
But the light just might be a train comin', man
I had to spend some money to win some money
I had the rooftop down but still had the tints up on it
Weed so good, I tensed up on it
Lil' ho tryna inch up on me while my bitch up on me
Rose gold look like ketchup on me
I let that chopper ring with no holy matrimony
All red like Patrick, homie
Redbone, got her lashes on me
I can't even sleep tight without a million cash inside the mattress, homie
Told bae I'm in the booth, you gon' have to play with the pussy on FaceTime
Just found out the President I voted for was already dead, slime (Yeah)
I bought a white Bentayga (Yeah)
Had to creep through the night in the spaceship (Yeah)
We was runnin' outside from the jakes (Yeah)
Now I put a lot of ice in the face (Yeah)
Keep a lot of shooters in the cut-cut (Yeah, yeah)
And I got a ride with the tuck-up (Yeah, yeah)
Gave a hundred racks to my brother (Yeah, yeah)
Pop out a check, I'ma fuck up (Yeah, yeah), huh (Huh)
And I got the whole hood on go (Whole hood on go)
Look at my neck, my wrist, my pinky on froze (Froze)
Stunnaman, stunnaman, stunnaman, drip-drip down to my toes (Down to my toes)
Still pull up in a Rolls-Rolls (Mula)6Embed
