1 ContributorMake It Rain (Remix) Lyrics
Woo! Roxanne!
It's Kells, bitches (Owwwww!)
You don't have to turn off the red light
Hahah, chyeah! (Scotty) Chyeah!
I'm in the building! (Let's make it rain on these niggas)
I see you Joey (Crack) Remix!

Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the Terror
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella (Remix!)
I make it rain, I make it rain
I'm in this bitch with the Terror (We The Best)
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella (Let's go!)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
Make it rain on them hoes (Remix!)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (Remix!)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (We The Best)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (Listennn!)
Oww!
You might also like
I be drillin' these chicks like Major Payne
When I make it rain, they be like, "Kells, do it again!" (Oh!)
From the club to the coupe, inside my gates
Up in my bedroom, screamin' each others' names (Oh! Ugh)
They was purrty-purrty, and I was flirty-flirty
Lil' dro, lil' bub, now they gettin' dirty-dirty
Don't ask me what my name isâ€”stupid bitch, I'm famous
You gon' make me aim this, leave your ass brainless
I'm tryin' to stay R&B, but these streets is a part of me
So don't get it twisted!
You see, I order one bottle, then I fuck with one model
Then I order more bottles; now, I got more models
I'm from that city where them niggas don't play, man
I take a chick to my room like caveman
So ask your girlfriend my name, I bet she go:
"Skeet-skeet-skeet-skeet, weatherman 'bout to make it rain!"

Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the Terror (Remix!)
Got a handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella (Let's go!)
I make it rain, I make it rain
I'm in this bitch with the Terror
One time for my homie, Sean Paul
Got a handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella
Coming home soon, we miss you nigga
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
Make it rain on them hoes (We The Best)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (We see no bond)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (Listennn!)
Oww! Blat, blat, blat, blat! Ayy, Joey, let me get 'em
It's Young Money, and we on like the television
The Weather Channel, but I do not broadcast
I throw up more cash, and change the forecast
Your boyfriend is lame, I make it rain on you
He never make it rain, like Southern California
Where's your umbrella? Now, get your raincoat
Baby, I make it flood, now, you gon' need a boat

Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the Terror (Remix!)
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella (Diamonds, let's go!)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Six City)
I'm in this bitch with the Terror (Magic City)
Got a handful of stacks (Rolex)
Better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh! Remix!)
Make it rain on them hoes (Remix!)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (Sue's Rendezvous)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (Get your money right)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (Listennn!)
Oww!Embed
