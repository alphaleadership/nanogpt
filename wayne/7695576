4 ContributorsBig Ballin’ Lyrics
Collegrove
Woah, Woah
Yeah, Yeah
Get ‘em, Get ‘em

Uh, told your fuckin’ ass I be back
Now them niggas goin’ crazy, tryna sign me back
License plate say “Young Money” nigga, for sure
Camped out in front of your house, we just lit up some smores
Now these niggas want bars, Butterfingers, Snickers and Mars
7 days a week, bet a nigga arm, yeah
Fresh we done done it, did it without stuntin’
Countin’ money need a calculator
The crib got a elevator, you not a skater
We gotcha you on the floor, paint yo’ ass red, turn this bitch into a art show
Now on the left side, we got the brand new Benz
And on the inside, got brand new Mac-10s
And in the middle - of the night, niggas a find ya
Me and 2 Chainz, bitch, we the new Big Tymers
Mannie Fresh on the beat he a true Big Tymer

Foreign cars
Foreign broads
Hoes with no bras
Neighborhood like big drawers
I’ma go, like what you know? What’s the scope?
You hurtin’? I front you 10 kilos
I like women
The light women, the light grinnin’, the light swimmin’
It’s light skinned, or dark skinned
We skinny dippin’
You penny pinchin’
We pussy pimpin’
Her pussy poppin’, I’m on it nigga
I’m on a mission, I got to get it
And me and Tune, like fuckin’ siblings
You fuckin’ gimmick
You fuckin’ wit’ us, you get whacked, your wig cracked
A big Sax, I shot ball, I pinch crack, I did that
I’m raw nigga, no Zig-Zag
My bitch bad, her bitch bad
You funny nigga, a Sinbad
I sit back, I get back
I BOW! BOW! I click-clack

I see you jockin’ 2 Chainz ‘cause he got on 10 chains and you know his friend’s name, so you know I’m Rick James
20-inch wheels is how I pull up
Either yo’ bitch hitch hikin’ or givin’ me thumbs up
It’s the New Orleans Jigga, man
We don’t do liquor, man
Everybody on lean ‘cept the triggerman
Like what you got to like, do who you got to do
Fight, we don’t do it fair, shoot a nigga every where, woah

10 years ago, a friend of mine, told me to start a label, get some artist to sign
I met Aubrey Graham and Onika Maraj, turned them to Drizzy Drake and Nicki Minaj
Got some studio time and a list of beats
We ain’t make songs, bitch, we made history
Best believe next year we was on TV
Gettin’ awards for Hip-Hop, Pop and R&B
Then we went on world tours and ya boy went to jail
Now we all got money and a story to tell
Onika, you still Young Money clique
Drizzy, you still Young Money clique
I said, “Miss Cita, as long as Tunechi got strength, guess what? You gon’ always be rich”
Yeah, shout out Tez Poe and Mack Maine, my whole Sqad as well
Now we gon’ take it from the N.O. straight to ATL
