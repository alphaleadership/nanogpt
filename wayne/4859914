11 ContributorsTalk 2 Me Crazy Lyrics
Oye!
Uh, uh, uh
No me hables así

Don't talk to me crazy, yeah, be there in the mornin'
I'm havin' a ball, get with you tomorrow, yeah
I'm goin' crazy, no one can fade me
Look what it made me

Fuckin amazin', comin' from basement
Look at their faces, look at 'em changin'
Life is amazin', look at this changin
Imagine us caged in, imagine us (Uh)
Imagine us anywhere other than this
I don't wan' talk about people I miss
Same time a shooter is takin' a hit
I'm in the studio makin' a hit
She in the mirror just makin' a fit
I'm in the game and I'm makin' this quick
How many more do they think I'ma get
How many more and I'm takin' this shit
I'm from somewhere far away
Keep the police far away
She said, "Put that scarf away
Don't you put your scars away"
I need one menage all the day
Think I'm Jigga, modern day
Even after we just ate
We still out here huntin' prey
Don't talk to me crazy
You might also like
*howls*
Hahahahaha
*howls*

Don't talk to me crazy, yeah, be there in the mornin'
I'm havin' a ball, get with you tomorrow, yeah
I'm goin' crazy, no one can fade me
Look what it made me

Don't talk to me brazy
That's chalk on the pavement
I'm ballin' you savin'
My daughter is dating', please, my nigga, don't talk to her crazy
I'm saucin', I'm gravy
And I don't need no favors
And I park the Mercedes, right on the pavement, and skate with my skaters
And you sorry, you hatin'
She from Saudi Arabia
And her homie from Asia, oh my God, they naughty by nature
Doctor Evil, Doctor Strange
And Doctor Jekyll, and Mister Hyde, they call me a patient
Damn, I'm caught in the matrix
Damn, I'm horny and wasted
Damn, that's fornication
Damn, I talk to the Asians
I don't fuck twelve, but they call me Tom Brady, so I ball like the Patriots
I sent you to Hell, and you should tell Satan that I'm the real Satan
And it's young mula baby
Don't drive down the way, baby, the weapons is drawn
I got the eraser, I'm rockin' these lasers, the watch and the bracelets
My lil' mama do vapor
But you don't want smoke, you talk to me crazy, I'ma go crazier
Don't talk to me crazy (Yeah), yeah, be there in the mornin' (Euro)
I'm havin' a ball (Yup), get with you tomorrow (Yeah, yeah), yeah
I'm goin' crazy (Yeah, yeah), no one can fade me (Yeah, yeah)
Look what it made me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), look what it made me

Look what it made me
Look what it made me
Look what it made me7Embed
