But understand that nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man, ever
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she's the one for me
And I'm not even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man, ever
Forever

I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she's the one for me
And I'm not even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man, ever
