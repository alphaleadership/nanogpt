23 ContributorsCrying Out For Me (Remix) Lyrics
Oww (Uh-huh)
Mario (Listen, girl)
And young Weezy, baby (Check it out, ohh)
So ya know that only means one thing
This the remix, baby

So I met this shawty the other day, I got her number
Called her up like, "What you doin'?" She say, "Nothin'"
I say, "What's good?" She say, "Not much," I said, "Guess what?" She say, "What's up?"
I say, "I think we should hook up," She say, "Uh—"
I say, "What?" She say, "But—" I say, "But, why you stuck?"
She say, "Fuck," I say, "Who?" She said, "Not you," I said, "Then who?" She say, "You know"
"I know what?" — "You know who," I said, "I do?" She said, "You do"
I said, "I do," but I really don't because it's you that I really want
And we can do what you really want, girl, we grown
And if he ain't gone treat you right, then I ain't gone treat you wrong, that's my word
And she done heard so many lies, she don't know what's true or not
Shawty like a valet service, I swear she been through a lot
But I put her car in park and never let her cry alone
I listen to her heart beat because it plays my favorite song

I can hear your heart
Cryin' out for me (Cryin' out for me)
I can hear your heart
Cryin' out for me, yeah (And it keeps on sayin')
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (And it keeps on sayin')
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (I can, baby)
I can hear your heart (Ooh-ooh)
Cryin' out for me

Baby, havin' late night conversations on your sofa
You tellin' me how he played you out over and over

Cryin' out for me (Girl, it's cryin', girl, it's cryin')

I don’t wanna confuse things (Ho-oh)
But I just can’t keep lyin' to myself
When you’re holdin' me (When you’re holdin' me)
I can feel your pain, oh, baby, let me
Be your dream
