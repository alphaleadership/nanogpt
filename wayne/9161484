2 ContributorsNat King Cole (Live from Allianz Park Sao Paulo Brazil) Lyrics
So unforgettable
More than incredible
More than a metaphor
But more than you're ready for
More than you're ready for
Ear Drummers

Take off your coat, take off your clichés
Show off a side that no one sees
You got the whole world right here in your pocket
Chasing those stardust melodies

So if you wanna live on
You gotta put on your finest
If you wanna sing your song
You gotta put the time into timeless
If you wanna take it all
Let the chandeliers fall (Fall)
While you're standing tall like the Taj Mahal
Be unforgеttable
Like Nat King Cole
Likе Nat King Cole
Like Nat King Cole

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah (Like Nat King Cole)
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah (Like Nat King Cole)Embed
