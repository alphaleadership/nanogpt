3 ContributorsLil Wayne: Why I’m the Predator (Interlude) LyricsThat's what they doin', Cam'ron
They actin' like these singers, man
I ain't—I ain't goin' to the studio 'till I got a situation
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer
Who—who gonna be on the hook?
Man, what is you doin'?
Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!You might also likeEmbed
