2 ContributorsThank You Lyrics
Black and grey pink stripes suit
Marc Jacobs hard bottoms I'm fly spreading my wings like true
And my date yeah she beautiful too
She went easy on the make-up but the bitch still cute
We ease out the Rolls and proceed forward, ain't a soul I'm passing twice
Feeling like a Graduation with all of these Flashing Lights
You fuckin right a lot of Veuve Clique gon' splash tonight
You damn right a lot of wives gon’ get smashed tonight
Red carpets, cameras, I say: “Millz yikes”
Shit this must be what victory feel like
Got you niggas stuck like still-life’s
Weezy told me: ‘kid we bout to know what makin' history feel like’
Young Money got 'em about to hurl like Garnett
I throw my hands in the air and scream: “Top of da world''
The champs have arrived thanks for the applause
You are far too kind, now pass us our award

Pass me that H20, I'm in the H2
Passing all my old bitches they hollering out I hate you
New bitches that I don't know like, Mack I wanna date you
Walt Disney on Ice, every time I skate through
I got that blue flame flow, its inferno
Chlamydia type of words, they will burn you
Your flesh is what I burn through, I’m son-ing you niggas, I'm paternal
I ain't going' nowhere, like Joe Paterno
I'm still calling shots from the press box
I make you niggas cough up a lung like S. Dot
Put hot sauce on my bullets, now ya flesh hot
Glove over my shooting hand, when I feel the Tecs hot
You niggas on da bench y’all gets no P.T
Because you can't ball hard like B.D., you niggas wanna be me
When you at home you listen to my CD
And roll your eyes every time you see me
I used to bump to B.G., I got a White House that ain’t in D.C
Try Atlanta nigga, me and my brother Toon
We riding round in Phantoms nigga, and Maybachs
With wheels that cost a fortune like Pat Sajak
And we still got that Vanna White
We done made it from Hollygrove to this, nigga this a Fabulous Life
Honeycomb hideout, Young Money beehive
Let me move to the side here comes the best rapper
You might also like
And I will not lose
I got them bitches looking at the bottom of my shoes
Call me first place Carter, I live in the lead
I’ma die with the title, and winning is vital
Women is after we get that money right now
My paper chase me it’s on my heels like some white socks
I’ma just go, cause I don’t really like stop
Pull this bitch out and shoot you once in da right spot
Y’all niggas phony, the top is so lonely
I had to tell the Devil you gone have to postpone me
Right now I’m in a race, in a race against time
Cause everybody else is like a race against mom
But momma kind a fast though, momma told me smash though
So I’m about to smash yo motherfucking ass ho
Motherfucking asshole, yeah I know this
But when you get cash out da asshole you got to be on some shit
Future billionaire, yeah I got to be on da list
Got a runway in my pants, cause all the models be on my dick
Young Money, Young Money, swallow that shit bitch
Santa Claus killer with a holiday shit list
You could check my imprint two new Tecs and a M-10
Every bullet in him swell up like a Blimp and
I get money hoe, what the hell I look like pimping?
Bitch I’m winning, ya dig!?1Embed
