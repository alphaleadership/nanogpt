1 ContributorWe Ain’t Mad Lyrics
Choppa, Choppa
Choppa Da Goon

We ain't leavin', mane, you can lock me up and throw the key
My niggas don't pop no pills, but my niggas gon' roll with me
Hoes chasin' me like Nikki did Professor Oglevee
You say that's your wifey, but she bussin' like a ho for me
Music is my wife, gettin' in the studio is sex to me
I'm so hood, bitches wanna stand next to me
Good Kush, nigga, why the fuck I need a recipe?
, must be gone off that ecstasy, but

We ain't even mad (Told y'all), we ain't even playing (Told y'all)
We ain't even mad (Told y'all), we ain't even playing (Told y'all)
We ain't even mad (Told y'all), we ain't even playing (Let me at 'em)
We ain't even mad (F.Dot), we ain't even—

I told y'all I fold y'all like lawnchairs
I'm in the streets like I'm homeless
I eat rappers like omelets
I'm so fly, I'm like hornet
My face mask is a black stocking
Thirty-shot mag' in my back pocket
Got crew on deck, got bricks on deck
Y'all can't stop it
Told y'all, but y'all ain't listen
I'm shittin', they pissin'
No, they pissed off
I gotta hard 'cause the hood where I'm from don't make shit soft
And I'm so perfect, I yawn at rehearsal
Shittin' on these niggas like  commercial
It's F.Dot Red Dot, come to the hole
 bullets  dot, red dot God to the Urkles, ayy

We ain't even mad (Told y'all), we ain't even playing (Told y'all)
We ain't even mad (Told y'all), we ain't even playing (Told y'all)
We ain't even mad (Told y'all), we ain't even playing (Told y'all)
We ain't even mad (Let's go)

We ain't even playin', but we turned our goofy on
Wearin' wires, talkin' to police, that's what you be on?
Truth be told, I be gone, swear I'm in another zone
'Nother world, every day's another girl
On top like a attic, flow hotter than acid
You other rappers old, gettin' ancient like Jurassic
Moneybag shawty, not talkin' paper or plastic
You niggas want beef? Get stretched like elastic

We ain't even mad (Told y'all), we ain't even playing (Told y'all)
We ain't even mad (Told y'all), we ain't even playing (Told y'all)
We ain't even mad (Told y'all), we ain't even playing (Told y'all)
We ain't even mad (Told y'all)

Told y'all
Told y'all
Told y'all
Told y'all
