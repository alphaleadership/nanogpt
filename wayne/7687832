Pshh, you know, at this point I've just realized that I've always been an experiment to other people
Tch, the fuckin' disrespect

My body is underwater, my head burns
My tummy's affected with all the shit earned
Lovers never existed, they were all words
Brothers never at peace, they were all crown birds
Like everytime I'm trying to be alivе
Everyone dies, еven orgasms, even for ballot shit
I was almost right, but I'm never right
Like Queen Ever, right?
The truth we implied by
But, yo, let's be alone and never set back
Call me a pro, whenev' we used the FILA's, we can't back
I've never given a chance to even realize what's right to theorize
A chance that we'd revise at least (Mmm)
I got more time, got one ear left to please
Bar to bar lines, more pillows to beat, listen (Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh)

Excuse me, pardon me, the wind, it blow so hard at me
Like mother nature arguing about some baby father beef
And I'm stuck in the middle of the sandwich like slaughter meat
Got my middle fingers to the cameras that's recording me
From y'all to me, brrt, stop callin' me unless you're ordering
I'm on the beach, I got my feet out, and I stay on my feet
The corner beat, I'm on a deep route, just throw the ball to me
Thought all this lean would have me senile, I guess they see now
Let's touch down, catch a beat-down like I catch touchdowns
I fuck 'round and slow the beat down and take the drums out
And speed up my flow, I'm so greedy, I'ma eat my own flow
And I'm in need of a flow, might eat me a rapper and I might as well eat me a ho (Yeah)

Spit ass, the paper written with ho snitch
Nip the grip truck and it's savage, "That man writin' his verses with frustration, he tal-"
Respiration, I'm far from the generation
"He rap, with a bad rap and a hat"
But I'm poppin' caps and they saying they music
Do they do it or use you for abusive use and the uses are trage-
Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, man, stop, stop!
What? What?
What is this?
What do you mean, I'm rapping
C-C-Cut the music off, cut the music off, let me cut the music off, please, please, please, thank you
Oh my gosh, what?
That was ass, man. That's old school, what you mean?
I-
This is old trash, man, this is old bootyEmbed
