6 ContributorsIntro Lyrics
Have you ever met a balla in whole damn life
Wit plenty money, plenty bitches, and a whole lot of ice
I'm that nigga man, the one they talkin' about
I'm that nigga man, wit the big ass house
Move over, Range Rover
I fuckin' told ya
Bubba gotta brand new solja
Who bought this bitch, Cash Money man
Let's start this bitch the new hurricane
See the niggas ain't gone like that, uh-uh
But the bitches gone ride that, uh-uh

Big money is heavyweight
That's Fresh and Big B
Two uptown shinners, number one stunna's
Fresh got a Berben, Baby got an all-black Hummer
Bought a Jag for the summer, green wit tan leather
TV's in the headrest, 20's on the compressor
So much ice in B's Roley you can't get a slow glance
He ain't have no money in his bank account till the overflow came
My Uncle Prime got a 5 and it's top of the line
19 inches cause 20's fucks up the ride
I'm worth millions, I'm a balla dog
Rolex full of diamonds I'll blind ya dog
17 wit 7 cars I'm a shina dog
You might also like
I'm an Uptown shina, neighborhood hunter
Red Hummer, Blue Hummer they both on chrome
Whoa, I got a million minutes on my Prime Co. phone
I'm an Uptown shina, neighborhood hunter
Red Hummer, Blue Hummer they both on chrome
Whoa, I got a million minutes on my Prime Co. phone

Now on the left side
Y'all girls deserve better
Now on the right side
Buy them all Gucci sweaters
Now in the front
Drink Cristal 'til you fall
Now in the back
Y'all niggas gon' straight up ball
Now on the left side
We sittin' on chrome
And on the right side
Plenty Prime Co. phones
And in the front
Well if it's on then it's on
Nigga in the back
Them some bitches I would love to bone
