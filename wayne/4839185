2 ContributorsMe & My Drank Lyrics
Yeah, ayy, yeah
I'm in the lab, no pad, no pen
Just a styrofoam cup I could pour a four in

Up in the studio, me and my drank
Deezle on the beat and let me do my thang
I'm thinkin' 'bout a certain, a certain somebody
That perfect somebody
That sexy purple body
She got service road curves and highway eyes
The road to her soul, just follow the road signs
And holla if you hear me
I love it when she's near me
I hate when she's away and Satan'll see the day
That Hell freeze over before I let her go
And let one of you bitch niggas get her, no, no, no, no
You don't know how to treat her
You don't know that I need ya
Baby, do you know that I need ya? Ayy
'Cause, baby, right now I feel like the whole world is against me
Ever since the death of Pimp C

Ayy, but me, I'm up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
I'm up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
Okay, you sit on 24's, I sip on 24's
You sit on 24's, I sip on 24's
I drop a four up in a 20 ounce and call that 24's
I dropped a four up in a 20 ounce and call that 24's

I'm ridin' out, leanin', never noddin' out
My girl trippin', damn, I gotta hear my momma mouth
My homeboys say I should slow down a little
But that shit I'm on make me slow down a lot
You bottle pop, I buy a bottled pop
Drop some syrup in it, get out my Waffle House
I live in Wayne's World, represent our South
And this how we do it, do it in our South
One more ounce'd make me feel so great
Wait, now I can't feel my face

I'm up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
I'm up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank

Will somebody please-please double cup me?
And, everybody, please-please don't judge me
Will somebody please-please double cup me?
And, everybody, please-please don't judge me

Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
Now for all y'all who ain't heard of him
Mr. M.O.E, the Barr Baby was a southside living legend of 3rd Ward
Bone hard, street veteran
It all started way back in '93
High school, he was a fool, he was only 18
With the dreams of becoming a ghetto superstar
Rolling in foreign cars through the streets of 3rd ward
It was all momma leave 'em with, a trace of M.O.E
And promethazine and he the codeine fiend
And his team was the coldest, every day they rolled thick
Niggas and hoes on dick
'Cause that's that screwed up clique
The Barr Baby, the Barr Baby, Barr BabyEmbed
