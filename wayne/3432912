Chea
You could get got on the spot
Shot in the club parking lot from the AK
I’m shootin’ ‘till the trigger get hot, ahh
Pull my sleeve over my hand and then spray
Don’t come with no revolvers, revolvers, (boy!)
Don’t come with no revolvers, revolvers, (boy!)
Don’t come with no revolvers please, ‘cause these things hold 50 each mothafucka
Yeah, Hot Spitta, yeah

Yeah, niggas know the lil’ dog, bouncin’ in the big ‘Lac
No I’m not Lil Scrappy, but I gotta lil’ scrap, aye
Hulk Hogan and you’re face down on the mat
Milk carton niggas, have ‘em wonderin’ where you at
Kidnap, nap the kids, find the bitch, split her wig
She’ll be in a cardboard box, underneath a bridge
Right where the bums live
One bitch, one night
Have her fuckin’ all my friends while I’m watchin’ bar fights
One might, say that
I’m a little conceited, plastic bags on my feet to keep the dirt up off my sneakers, yeah
In high school I was hated by my teachers ‘cause we had the same car but mines had more features

Chea
You could get got on the spot
Shot in the club parking lot from the AK
I’m shootin’ ‘till the trigger get hot, ahh
Pull my sleeve over my hand and then spray
Don’t come with no revolvers, revolvers, (boy!)
Don’t come with no revolvers, revolvers, (boy!)
Don’t come with no revolvers please, ‘cause these things hold 50 each mothafucka

See when my enemies came, nigga I ain’t never fled
I kept a bone crusher on me, I wasn’t never scared
My clique, all real niggas, we never hoes
Make sure your chest stay open like we never close
(Young Money!)
Matter fact, we’ll put ya behind, we never close
And if they find out where ya at, nigga we never told
It’s all platinum, we never gold
See, nickel bags is something we never sold
See a snitch, nigga, he better roll
Money in stacks, it never fold
I don’t give head to my loot, but I got cheddar to blow
I don’t give away shit, but I got cheddar to show
Try to jack some and watch I beretta ya throat
Niggas went from coppin’ Jettas to boats, from pushin’ boats to ‘copters
Gettin’ off, hoppin’ straight in a Boxter
Got a pretty red thing that keep her face in my boxers
And I don’t take red to Red Lobster, nigga holla!
Yeah

Chea

Shot in the club parking lot from the AK
I’m shootin’ ‘till the trigger get hot, ahh

Don’t come with no revolvers, revolvers, (boy!)
Don’t come with no revolvers, revolvers, (boy!)
Don’t come with no revolvers please, ‘cause these things hold 50 each mothafucka
(Put the house up!)
You don’t wan’ be out in the streets
Mouth full of blood and a soul full of heat
A house full of thugs and the orders of me, like don’t leave ‘till you get all of the keys
Hat full of holes and ya blood on my sneaks, like these is 650, ya blood too cheap
Me, I’m from New Orleans where we hustle in the heat
And enough work’ll have the cops hustlin’ for me, shit
Little city but ain’t nothin’ here for free, I’ma uptown nigga, put my money by my teeth, yeah
And it’s magic whenever I hear the beat
But give me a hundred keys. y’all a never hear from me, shit
Young Money and the leverage is deep, I am better than I ever been, that other shit was weak
Fuck making it in the industry, I made it in the streets
Now my eyes is arms and I’m takin’ what I see nigga

Chea
You could get got on the spot
Shot in the club parking lot from the AK
I’m shootin’ ‘till the trigger get hot, ahh
Pull my sleeve over my hand and then spray
Don’t come with no revolvers, revolvers, (boy!)
Don’t come with no revolvers, revolvers, (boy!)
Don’t come with no revolvers please, ‘cause these things hold 50 each mothafucka
Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh

It ain’t a secret I hold heaters, roll reefer
Everyday I’m walkin’ in new sneakers
Sunk in that two-seated Aston, and Hamilton blastin’, niggas tryna hate but I clip ‘em off like ashes (ashes)
Check my swag, young cocky and flashy
And look how I glittered my arm and glittered my charm
Nigga, I’m right here when the drama pop off
Niggas better run to mama when them llama’s pop off
See my connect in the Bahamas steady tryna hate
Before I hit ‘em with the 8, I’ma tell him to his face:
“Nigga, you a chump. I ain’t need you no way
You is the little man, wasn’t feedin’ me no way” haha
Chea

Don’t come with no revolvers, revolvers, (boy!)
Don’t come with no revolvers, revolvers, (boy!)
Don’t come with no revolvers please, ‘cause these things hold 50 each mothafucka1Embed
