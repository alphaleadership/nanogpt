Ear Drummers
Turn up!
Ya not hear me
I said "Turn up!" (Mike Will Made-It)
Woo!
Bitches and bottles
You know what is it
Ay, DJ Khaled

Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put in ice in your watches and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles (Okay!)
Bitches and bottles, (Hustle Gang my nigga) let's get it started (Let's hear what I got, ay)

I’m turned up 'til my knob broke, you say
"Turn it down," I say, "Nah ho"
My neck rocky like Balboa, my watch official, it's uncalled for
In the St. Regis on all floors, I got six sluts on all fours
They french kissin', say bonjour
I got my own shine but I want yours
I’m stupid rich, got stupid bitch, who stupid thick in Louboutin
Don’t like me, fuck you again, wanna fight me, well come do it then
Right hand to God on everything, I see the hearts of men and they very lame (Okay)
I won’t entertain no punk shit, they talk shit and I run shit
Boy, you tryin’ to get what I been here (Been here)
Held it down for like ten years (Ten years)
I’m gettin’ it in 'til it's unreal, let’s sell one album like ten mill
Plus my swag is stupid low IQ (Dumb), hurt nigga feelin’
I don't try to (Dumb)
But when you ballin’ like I do (You), you know sucker niggas don’t like you so—
You might also like
Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put in ice in your watches and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, (Uhh) let's get it started

It's Tunechi, you bitch you
I like sticky weed and sticky pussy (Sticky pussy)
Sittin' on like a hundred mill' (Hundred mill'), I treat that shit like whoopee cushion (Whoopee cushion)
Ballin' on them fuck niggas, they on the bench, I bench press 'em
They hatin' from the sidelines, they pissed off, piss test em’
Man, I'm on that lean (I'm on that lean), liquor for the bitches (For the bitches)
Who fuckin' with me? (Fuckin' with me?) All I hear is crickets
I got stank up in my swisher, my bitch pussy smell like roses
She on that Molly, I'm on that Mary, I'm on that Mary like Joseph
Man, I'm married to this shit, you can call it Shit Carter (Shit Carter)
Dick stay up like it got insomnia
All them niggas hatin' (Hatin'), fuck ya in ya pussy
The best things in life are free (In life are free), free my nigga Boosie (My nigga), gone (Gone)

Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put in ice in your watches and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started
Ayy, let's order bitches and bottles (DJ Khaled)
Let's order bitches and bottles
Let's order other, other models
Let's order other, other models  (Let's go)

Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put in ice in your watches and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started

I make hits, I find hits (Let's order bitches and bottles)
And I put hits out
It's We The Best, it's YMCMB
Lil Wayne, T.I., Future, DJ Khaled
Fuckboys suck a dick, bow down
Kiss the Ring

Bitch, I'm the biggest mogul of the game, salute7Embed
