20 ContributorsLoyalty Lyrics
Kane is in the building, nigga
Yeah, Bigga Than Life
Get it how you live
Big money every way, blatt!

Uhh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Countin' cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t wanna leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know (Before I leave home)
I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know, before I leave home

So fresh, bag full of money when I hit the curb
Just cooked up, left the kitchen full of birds, ya heard?
That's the word, you could get served
From the bullets to the keys, is how we urge
To move on and groove and get the money straight
Flip another cake, 27, 28
I got the tax on the bubble
The money in the hummer, we shine every summer
Yeah, so we swagged out, Gucci'd down
Louie'd down, hood down, put it down, Uptown
Catch me rollin in my Bentley
Tooled up pussy, wet bitch and I’m all in it
You might also like
Uhh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Countin' cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t wanna leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know (Before I leave home)
I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know, before I leave home

Uhh, sunshine like the brightest day
Mama, do you remember the time? Michael J
When I seen the video, I said, "That's gon' be me"
And I ain’t have to dream, I made it my reality
Folks laughed at me, now everybody mad at me
I skipped class and I shitted on the faculty
Young Money greedy, Cash Money greedy
Get it I’m gon eat it, never bite the hand that feeds me
Shoutout Weezy, Stunna and Mack, baby
Top back, South Beach, hoes drive me crazy
Watching out for fake shit, rats on some snake shit
Give me racks for my statements, I’m that amazing

Uhh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Countin' cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t wanna leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know (Before I leave home)
I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know, before I leave home
Uhh, on my way to get it
I'm a hustler, write it down, take a picture, bitch, print it
Ducking the lieutenant, staying on my pivot
The game ain’t sweet, but money make you forgive it
Uhh, and nothing's promised but a graveyard
Can't see myself dyin' broke, Ray Charles
Yeah, now rock steady in this motherfucker
Paper come fast, Tom Petty in this motherfucker
Uhh, now do a doughnut in the money
I’m on a paper chase, but the paper ain't running
Now fuck the world 'til its cummin', here it comes
We get the bread and the crumbs, Young Money

Uhh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Countin' cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t wanna leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know (Before I leave home)
I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know, before I leave home1Embed
