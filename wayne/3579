17 ContributorsLoyalty (Remix) Lyrics
Yeah, YMCMB
Stunna man, money mix, ya understand?
Mula crazy, let's get it
Blatt!

Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know

Yeah, red ribbon, ducking Feds 'til we pass out
Birdcage, duck the shine 'til they let him out
There's more money now, and we done flipped the draught
Hella choppers, clip pulled, nigga, Junior out
G'd up, I took it from the G-code
Presidential suites, with this cash flow
Uptown gangsta, VL hustla
Third Ward general, Young Cash Money
You might also like
Before I leave home, I kiss my babies, hope I return safely
Knowin' the odds against me, these devils, they tryin' to break me
I'm still loyal, my habits became lavish
Dreams of new endeavors, pub deals and owning masters
And my homeboys, aid to my conditions
I made 'em all managers, execs and assistants
And most of 'em don’t understand, some won’t listen
We might fall off, throw fits and get missing
But you're still my dawg, ha, and my big homie spoil me
I feel cause I’m the youngest, he expects a little more from me
So I try to stay humble, and if you can see my vision
You can see us Cash Money 'til the motherfucking ending
Brisco

Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know

Uh, YMCMB baby (Mack Maine!)
Before I leave home, kiss my girl on the cheek and then I say a prayer
If looks was bullets, I woulda been dead from stares
I bypassed the elevator and I took the stairs
Now the hard work got me ridin' in Bentleys and Lears
Homie I'm so prepared, on point like infrareds
I live my life, so to die, I ain’t never scared
And when I drop, I'm not gon' flop, I'm no Andre Ware
I can't see you haters, guess my vision's impaired
My niggas already there, yes we done got that title
You other rappers losing weight, minus the lipo
Breath of fresh air, pump lung money
Cat scan say "Cash Money", heart bleed Young Money, one hunny
Yeah, Twist! Young Money
Before I leave home, well mannered, nice, respectful young man
Momma taught me well but daddy taught me through a jail cell
Raised as a prince and Young Money then took me in
Made it official, YM young'n, CMB, what's happenin'?
Yeah, I gotta do it for my hood
See before I stepped off the block, I told all them niggas I would
Let’s do it for the OC, I put in work out on TV
And step one over a G, now put your hands for lil old me, yeah

Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know

Chyeah, stay true to my team (Who that?)
YMCMB a-a.k.a the greatest (Le'go)
Yeah, that’s why they hate us (Hate)
Went from layaway (To what?) to rocking all the latest, fashion
Name a model chick I ain’t smashing (Ha)
New cars for all my homies when I bring that cash in (C'mon)
Never had my father in my life, he was a deadbeat
Moms worked two jobs to keep Jordans on my feet
Now that I’m on, ain't shit to worry 'bout
I bought my momma a mansion and moved the damn south
Now what you talking bout? Got my Bugatti on the way Stunna
Money coming in fast like the Road Runner, Bow!
Whistle for my family, my label and my set
It's Young Money 'til my day the death, tell the rest take a rest
Thoroughbreded and blessed, my grind stressed
Sometimes yet nevertheless, a young'n shining with the best
Promised my momma one day I’ll be a rhymer, she left
But I love her so much, it’s like she never took a step
Reality showed me them colors that some of us couldn't
Look at you now that we all what you thought, some of us wouldn't
Said he gettin that dough right, ready jetting from police
Petty better than rolled dice, some cold nights, they deadin' us, no light
But I'm here now, and we here like something, nothing compared like
CMB, I’m privileged in this legacy, that’s real life
My brother's keeper, protect me from my friends Lord
My enemies’ll bleed ya, choking off anesthesia
Throw my signs high, I'm recognized worldwide, worldwide
I’m in it to get whatever it cost me, it’s true loyalty

Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know, before I leave homeEmbed
