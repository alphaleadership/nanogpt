21 ContributorsMade It Lyrics
Girl, you're workin' with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend the cash, yeah, his bag, yeah
Girl, you're workin' with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend the bag, yeah, his cash, yeah
Girl, you made it, you made it
Oh yeah, you made it, you made it
Baby girl, you made it, you made it
Oh yeah, you made it, you made it

It's been a long time comin' (Comin')
All these blessings rollin' in, I ain't even see 'em comin' (Comin')
Too hard, too hard, I been goin' too hard now, ah
They say I need a vacation, say I need to slow down
And I ain't tryna slow down
Pretty face with a bad attitude (Bad attitude)
Workin' like I got too much to lose (Too much to lose)
Built this shit up on two by twos
I want it now, I paid too many dues

Head up and my heels high (Heels high)
This what life supposed to feel like (Feel like)
Lookin' like I'm in the gym right (Gym right)
Takin' side pics, looking thick like (Thick like)

Girl, you're workin' with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend the cash, yeah, his bag, yeah
Girl, you're workin' with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend the bag, yeah, his cash, yeah
Girl, you made it, you made it
Oh yeah, you made it, you made it
Baby girl, you made it, you made it
Oh yeah, you made it, you made it

No more stressin'
I can't control God's timing, learned my lesson
Can't trust too many people, shit gets reckless
Mood rings, I've changed, I've changed
Who's really on my side now?
Who's really gettin' down now?
My baby told me true love, true love, every day, it's new love
Wake up to my daughter and my hubby, now that's crew love
Guess I never knew love

Head up and my heels high (Heels high)
This what life supposed to feel like (Feel like)
Throw it back, throw it back now (Back now)
For the nine-nine and the two thou'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, you're workin' with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend the cash, yeah, his bag, yeah
Girl, you're workin' with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend the bag, yeah, his cash, yeah
Girl, you made it, you made it
Oh yeah, you made it, you made it
Baby girl, you made it, you made it
Oh yeah, you made it, you made it

Self-love is the best love (Best love), yeah, yeah
