34 ContributorsNeck of the Woods Lyrics
Uptown!
Yeah
Yeah
Nigga!

Well, let me take you to the neck of the woods
In my hood (Uptown)
Show you what we livin' like
(Uptown)
Well, let me take you to the neck of the woods
In my hood (Uptown)
Show you what we livin' like
(Uptown)

Chyeah! Gangsta to the core
Ankle-wrap flamer, paint your kitchen floor
With your whore, shit you can't ignore
Things you endure when you fucking with the boy!
All I heard was, "Weezy, don't kill me no more"
I hear your bullshit, I play matador
I'm out of category, I ain't there with y'all
I got a positive vibe, but I ain't scared of y'all
Get the kid negative, never that at all
That rat-a-tat go off, that blat-kak-kak-kak-kak-kak
I got a bitch so fine, her name "Pérignon"
She know how to stash quarters in her carry-on
I blow out-of-town grass when I'm out of town
Uptown in the building—not a sound
'Cause killers don't get heard about
They get whispered about or you get murdered out, nigga!
You might also like
Well, let me take you to the neck of the woods
In my hood (Uptown), show you what we livin' like
Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
Got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, nigga!
Well, let me take you to the neck of the woods
In my hood (Uptown), show you what we livin' like
Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
Got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, nigga!

The first shot, the first nigga got shot
We bust him open like a blunt on a Marley, nigga (Yeah)
A hundred G's, nigga, score us some keys
And then, we went to the hood (Believe that), and then, we started to ballin', nigga (Started ballin, nigga)
We know them people been paper-chasin' (Watch them)
So we stay out the way, then we pull out the Harleys, nigga (Let's ride)
We keep the gauge close (Yeah), in case you won't know (Uh-huh)
You come to the hood? I bet you a target, nigga
It's all good 'til you catch a case (Stay up, nigga)
A nigga never escape because you 'dicted to money, nigga (You addicted to money, nigga)
Well, let me bring you back yesterday (Yeah)
A lil' homie I know got full of that barma nigga (Ease up, nigga)
Fuckin round with that Kid-N-Play (Play too much, man)
Nigga fuckin with G's, a nigga twisted his body, nigga (Nigga twisted his body)
Well, let me tell you 'bout this game I know
(You keep flippin' dough, homie) And you'll be riding the flyest, nigga
Well, let me take you to the neck of the woods
In my hood (Uptown), show you what we livin' like
Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
Got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, nigga!
Well, let me take you to the neck of the woods
In my hood (Uptown), show you what we livin' like
Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
Got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, nigga!

You got it on your mind, lil' daddy, say somethin'
All that play buckin' gon get your face buttoned up
Now when you smirk, you look like Jay-Z shirt
Fucking with the turf
I'm puffin' on that Smurf—fuck you, come holler
And tell Papa, "Put away your dollars—your son got choppers"
And if you got enemies, your son got enemies
Yeah, believe that, nigga! Fuck 'em!
That's uptown energy, nigga!

Don't waste no time on no bullshit (Bullshit)
If it ain't hood shit, we spend a lil' paper, nigga (We spend a lil' paper, shawty)
Well, if you catch 'em in the hood, nigga (If you catch 'em)
It's all good (It's all good); shit, go 'head, do me that favor, nigga (Bow down, bitches)
Well, let me take you deep down in the inside (Deep down)
It's where they hustle and the homies try to get it right (Grinding, nigga)
It's when you got to ride, it's when the homie die
And the money can't stop the pain in the inside (Believe that)
Well, let me take you to the neck of the woods
In my hood (Uptown), show you what we livin' like
Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
Got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, nigga!
Well, let me take you to the neck of the woods
In my hood (Uptown), show you what we livin' like
Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
Got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, nigga!

Please believe it
Birdman and Birdman Junior
We hear them bitch-ass niggas talking, you heard?
But we up by one, you heard? They playing catch-up
Cash Money Millionaires
Hot Beezoh (Beezoh)! Holding it down, Birdman (Birdman)
You got a problem?
You know how we rock, homie! (Homie)
Hold Uptown down, big dog!
Big dog! You heard me? (You heard me?)
