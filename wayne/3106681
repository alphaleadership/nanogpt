Girl, I needed you
I was tryna settle down
Baby, I was tryna see this through, yeah
Now you ain't nowhere around
Baby, I cannot believe this true
I can't believe this true
Girl, I believed in you
But now it ain't nowhere to go

Girl, I should have left you alone
I should have hung up the phone
Leavin' you them messages
That you never checked
And I should have took back that ring
â€˜Cause it doesn't mean anything to you

I hope you know you played yourself
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself
Girl, you know you played yourself
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself (Oh, no)
Girl, you know you played yourself
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself
Girl, you know you
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself
Girl, you played yourself
