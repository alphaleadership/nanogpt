7 ContributorsGrind Lyrics
Yea, you understand me nigga?
Fully loaded with it, to the sky with it
(We done it Baby)
Believe that homeboy

And we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
And we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
I'm grindin' ya'll

Fuck it, we gon' get it on 'em
Pop it and split it homie
Livin' and hustle on em, grind till we billions on 'em
More money new lens, more money new Benz
More money, two twins, what we totin' homie?
Got it from the bottom, raised to the top with it
Hundred million rock with it, hundred mill drop with it
Got the Benz and the Phantom like way back
40-50 cars in my hood, bitch touch that
Play the model nigga, drinkin' out the bottle with it
On the island with it, money and power with it
Watch the lil nigga jam on you bitches
While I'll be sittin' on the island nigga fuckin' these bitches
One hundred

And we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
And we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
I'm grindin' ya'll

Same clothes, three days, watch me get my grind on
My auntie say I smoke too much that's why a nigga mind gone
I can't stop hustlin', I get it from my dad
All I know is bumps, Cuban stamps and zip-lock bags
Rental cars tinted out, time to hit the interstate
Got a fetish for Ferrari's and bad bitches I can renovate
See I ain't talkin' penny weight, I'm talkin Big Pun
I'm talkin' breakin' it down till the last union
Poppy know my forte, I get 'em and drop 'em
And if they want it up the road
We shak'em down and re-rock 'em
I gotta get it, it's all about a dollar
I do it everyday so I'm living blue collar

And we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
And we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
I'm grindin' ya'll
See I came across the state line, know I had to get mine
A hundred mill worth of ticket
A full straight grind
You know I had to get back what I started
Had to get back what I lost, new fleet that I ordered
Got more chips flippin' out the other licks
Bag full of birds homie, born hood rich
Came from the rocket straight to the top
That's how we gettin' it, big money won't stop it

And we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
And we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
I said we gon' grind
I'm grindin' ya'll1Embed
