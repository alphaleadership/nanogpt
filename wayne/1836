67 ContributorsI’m So Paid Lyrics
Rubbing on that Italian leather
Them Konvict jeans on
You ready?
Yeah
Yeah
Geah! (Konvict)

I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money?  (Ayy)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
I'm so paid

I see police on that crooked-I
Doing a hundred on Interstate 95
My shawty leaning, blasting that Do or Die
Wishing that a muddasucka would, ‘cause we certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hope they never call off
And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
Rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than let them haters come and make a name off me
That's why...

I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Yo, Bu—I told you I had you, homeboy
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy, yeah!)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
Yo, 'Kon, I got you!
I'm so paid

She said, "Young, why your voice so hoarse?"
I just sound like money, baby, I should've been a Porsche (Vroom)
Paint look like a sugar-free Red Bull (Woo)
I'm so paid, you know I keep a pocket full (Haha)
And that's before the taxes
Took my whole gross net and hid it under my mattress (Damn)
I used to get bored and count twenties for practice (What?)
Paper therapy, we let that money relax us (Yeah)
Gold chains 'round my neck just like Michael Phelps
I made a killing in the water (Oh), kill them with the water (Oh)
Against all odds, and I will not stop (Will not stop)
They try and keep me on bottom, but I prefer the top (Yeahhh)
And my project chick, I moved her next to Joc
She said the house was too small, I moved an extra block (Haha)
So, baby, get your ass up, I need an extra block (Ayy)
I told her, "Do the speed limit and no extra stops"
And that's why... (That's why)
I get it in 'til the sunrise (Yeah! Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Yeah! Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid (Yeah)
Number one hustler, getting money (What's up? What's up?)
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
You can't count it!
I'm so paid

I am the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off, that's all
(Guess what?) I won't be taking that fall
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm paying them for
Haha, ain't that funny?
‘Cause niggas, they want war but ain't got money
‘Cause I've seen them all talking until they start gunning
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing running
Yeah, Akon, Weezy (Jeezy!)
Black Royals holdin' down Jersey (Jersey)
Devine making sure we getting it up front
My little brother Bu got that vision, baby
I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid (Yeah)
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
I'm so paid (Sheesh!)

Ah-em, Big Money Weezy
White wife-beater with the Sig underneath it
How do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct, yeah
I'm ballin', we ball out
Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns to y'all house
Only to find out you live in a dollhouse, damn!
But I thought you was tough, though
We carry choppers on our necks; call it "cutthroat"
We bury cowards on the set that they come from
We know magic, turn weed smoke to gun smoke
We! Bomb first when we ride
You! In a hearse when you ride (Ayy, ayy)
I put my shoe down, baby
And I'm holding down Young Mula, baby
That's why...

I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money?  (Ayy)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
I'm so paid4Embed
