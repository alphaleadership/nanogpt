4 ContributorsChange the World Lyrics
What, what, what, what, what, what
Huh (Huh)
What (What)
If I could change the world (If I could change the world)
Huh (Huh)
What (What - what)

Look
If I had the world, dog, I'd make hustlin' good
And if I could I'd put work every hustler's hood
I can't lie - this world is scary to me
I carry two gats - you won't hear nobody buryin' me
None of my people would have to pay tax or bills
Even all the new niggas oughtta average a mill
If I could change the score, we'd never hustle no more
And every bizite that I lizight 'll be like "whoa"
And the police would be for here only for the old folks
So if we have a problem, we strap up and hold court
If I could change it - man, if the world was mine
Nobody'd have to take nothin' cause we'd all shine
If I ruled the world, nigga wouldn't have no beef
It'll be a decline in the murder rate on the streets
If the world was mine we wouldn't need no killers
We'll put A/C in these project windows
You might also like

If I could change the world
I'd make it much better for you and me
I'd erase these hard times we had, yeah
And we'd ball 'til we fall - can you feel that?
Yeeeeeaaaaahhhhh

Come on, let's do this shit - yo, my party don't quit
And every record Cash Money put out 'll be a hit
I'd dig a ditch for the hatas, put 'em deeper with that
And I could murder a nigga and wouldn't spend a week in the pen
Man, we'd all have houses, a half-a-block
We'd all be on chrome in a Benz drop-top
All the women would be big, fine with a cute face
And the children would be the kind that stay in they place
If the world was mine I'd unite my peeps
My mom and my dad would be in this world with me
But if a nigga still trip, you can hit him with Glock
And just to keep it real I'll bring back Biggie and Pac
Man, we'd all get along - we'll be a family
That's just how it'll be if this world was for me
If I ruled the world, wouldn't be no politics
Blacks would have a lot of shit - that Bentley and that Prowler shit


More blunts to smoke up on the streets with peace
Without a worry on our mind, not duckin' police
If we could go back in time, you could have what's mine
That's for shig my nig - we ain't gotta slang that iron
Play the block all day without runnin' and duckin'
And everybody drugs raw - they don't cut it with nothin'
It ain't mine - I just gotta get it how I live
Can't question God on what He made a biz what it is
If I ruled the world, my family wouldn't fight
Everything in order - everybody all right
If the world was mine I'll still be grindin'
I'll flip big blocks for Bria and Bryan
And if you move a hundred bricks, you get a Benz for free
Oh yeah, and Beyonce'll have twins for me
Man, if this world was for the lil' B.G
Everybody'd be straight, everybody'd live sweet - uh-huh


Huh (Huh)
What (What)
If I could change the world (If I could change the world)
Huh (Huh)
What (What - what)
Look - what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, whatEmbed
