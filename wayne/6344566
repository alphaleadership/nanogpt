I want this shit forever mane
I want this shit forever mane
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mane
I want this shit forever mane

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mane
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forеver mane, evеr mane, ever mane
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane
I want this shit forever mane
I want this shit forever mane
I want this shit forever mane

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane
I want this shit forever mane
I want this shit forever mane
I want this shit forever mane
Okay, hello it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last

I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever maneEmbed
