Oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh

I'm not a crybaby
I'm the crybaby
A caterpillar that got stuck
Mr. Moth, come quick with any luck
A long walk to a dark house
A Roman candle heart, keep us far apart
I'm cocktail party doing alright, hate me baby
Maybe I'm a piece of art
Oh, my friends all lie and say

They only want the best wishes for me
Oh, three, two, one, we go live!

Oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess
(Little hot mess) Whoa, whoa
And oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess
(Little hot mess) Whoa, whoa, whoa
See Fall Out Boy LiveGet tickets as low as $13You might also like
I can make your heart slow
I can feel the weather in my bones
Wish hard enough, I can turn it to what I like
Your pupils (big) big (roll), they're rolling like dice

They say they only want the best wishes for me
(They only want the best for me)
Oh, three, two, one, we go live!

Oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess
(Little hot mess) Whoa, whoa
And oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess
(Little hot mess) Whoa, whoa

Not the boy I was, the boy I am is just venting, venting
(Oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh)
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city
(Oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh)
I'm not the boy I was, the boy I am is just venting, venting
(Oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh)
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city
(Oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh)
They say they only want the best wishes for me
(They only want the best for me)
Oh, three, two, one, we go live!

Oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon (You're a faded moon)
Stuck on a little hot mess
(Little hot mess) Whoa, whoa
And oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess
(Little hot mess) Whoa, whoa, whoa13Embed
