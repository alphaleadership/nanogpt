21 ContributorsS On My Chest Lyrics
"That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead"
(Alright, alright)

I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead
Yeah... uhh
If stunna say the nigga dead then the nigga dead
If stunna say the nigga dead then the nigga dead
If youngin' say the nigga dead, then the nigga dead
If youngin' say the nigga dead, then the nigga dead

Reporting from Kim's corner store
Hollygrove, 17th carnivore
Ridin' through the city in a Tonka toy
I got old money, coulda bought a dinosaur, huh
Only ride Chevy, never drive a Ford
And my Coupe doors open like plaza doors, yup!
Red thick women (uhh) I's adore
I'm a whore, you know that I'm a whore, yup!
Cash Money, Cash Money, monster boys
Mafia bitch! Even the cops avoid
And you say you want beef, then I got you, boy, ugh
I'll just let the Big Mac, whop' a boy
See my dreads hangin' lookin' like a rasta, boy
Fuck with my roster and I turn into Mufasa, boy, haha!
We run up in your casa, boy
And blast off like NASA, boy! Haha

I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest (Yeah)
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead
If stunna say the nigga dead then the nigga dead
Cash Money, Ca— Cash Money
Cash Money, Ca— Cash Money
That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead

Yeah, Cash Money is an army nigga, better know it's gravy
If you ever fuck with Young and if you ever fuck with Baby
Shit gon' be crazy, nigga doin it like the 80's
Buncha young nigga poppin' off and they sprayin'
Up in the early, we thank Him for the sunshine
Got to get my bling on, reach for my chrome nine
Kiss mama cause we goin' out and get mines
Next nigga in line, seventeen on the grind
Shoot first, nigga not seeing mines
Big purses, million-dollar headlines
Five drops, O.G., the last Big Tyme'
Lord to the game, nigga, 'til it's my time
"Like Father Like Son," nigga, this time
Junior got the fame and the game, mastermind
Two hundred on the dash, nigga, watch me mash
Doing doughnuts in my hood gettin' paper bags
I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead

Ribbon is red, that how we pledge
An Uptown C.M.B. blood 'til I'm dead
That's what I said, I'll put some change on your head
If you ever cross a line nigga it's nothin' but bread
Fifty shots I'm hot, nigga we won't stop
From puttin' candy on the slab nigga stirrin' them pots
Put the hammer on the jam nigga pull it and pops
And put the rubber on the bands nigga stackin' his knots

Bitch I'm the boss, bih.. bitch I'm the boss
And bury me like my father on the cross
And carry thy teen, I shall over a cross
Shorty got that game on lock, like a vault
Weezy Baby, cayenne pepper, no salt
Windows down on the hog in the winter, it's yo' fault
Hehehe, I don't jump on the track, I pole vault
I got that "S" on my chest, man I'm supposed to ball
I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead2Embed
