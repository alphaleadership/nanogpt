21 ContributorsFinito Lyrics
Ayo, that special-order LV backpack?
I wasn't wearing it just to show off
I got plutonium in there
Mr. Williams, we'll be taking your orders now

I'ma live the dream, yo, no time to sleep, yo
If you know what we know, y'all niggas finito
Oh, it's an animal anthem
Oh, it's an animal anthem
Looking through the peephole, I can see the people
Looking for the heat, yo, y'all niggas finito
Oh, it's an animal anthem
Oh, it's an animal anthem

What's poppin', poppin'
Yeah, the spot is (Poppin', poppin')
Yeah, my knot is (Poppin', poppin')
My Glock is (Poppin', poppin')
So provocative

Ayo, them bricks that they front me out of the country
Do that thing monthly, mujeres still want me (Mujeres)
Them dudes finito, I sell chico (Uh-huh)
To a chico, magnifico (What!)
The truck and my seat low, magnetic, your thug cosmetic
Swag synthetic, you get your shit shredded (What!)
Osmosis, scoliosis, prognosis
Ferocious, get a dosage—yo, hold up
Put your hands in the air, yeah, this a hold-up
 kush, kung fu karate
Kawasaki, akhi, your shit sloppy, probably
Gold guns to say the least (What!), that's just for Ray Lewis
Wherever there's Indians, I'ma come and play the chief
Ajuua! They basura
Neptunes don't gotta be thugs, 'cause I'm their shooter (Ba-ba-ba-ba!)
My new guns is plastic, new N.O.R.E.'s a classic (What!)
You might also like
I'ma live the dream, yo, no time to sleep, yo (Owwww!)
If you know what we know, y'all niggas finito
Oh, it's an animal anthem (Haha)
Oh, it's an animal anthem (Oww)
Looking through the peephole, I can see the people
Looking for the heat, yo, y'all niggas finito (Tunechi)
Oh, it's an animal anthem
Oh, it's an animal anthem

What's poppin', poppin' (Yeah!)
Yeah, the spot is (Poppin', poppin')
Yeah, my knot is (Poppin', poppin')
Ayy, Norey, I told you I got you, nigga
My Glock is (Poppin', poppin')
So provocative

Ugh! I split Swishers with my thumb, slime
They say numbers don't lie except one-time
Young Tune got goons on the front line
These hoes tryna get on like they unsigned
Side-step counter, right, left, punchline
Real niggas don't do sit-ups when it's crunch time
Get high, sing songs on my guitar
Got your girl on my dick like a see-saw
My son tell his friends, "Daddy got a racecar"
T roll blunts longer than the space bar
Dreadhead, high socks with some Vans on
Bullet hole bigger than the Grand Canyon
Neptunes on the beat, Norey, what it is?
Chop body parts off, stick 'em in the fridge
Yeah, kiss my ass under the mistletoe
Young Money, motherfucker, if you didn't know
I'ma live the dream, yo, no time to sleep, yo (Hahahaha!)
If you know what we know, y'all niggas finito
Oh, it's an animal anthem (Woo!)
Oh, it's an animal anthem
Looking through the peephole, I can see the people
Looking for the heat, yo, y'all niggas finito
Oh, it's an animal anthem
Oh, it's an animal anthem

What's poppin', poppin'
Yeah, the spot is (Poppin', poppin')
Yeah, my knot is (Poppin', poppin')
My Glock is (Poppin', poppin')
So provocative

Animalistic, futuristic gold biscuit (Animal)
Artistic, hands roll kush terrific (What!)
Alien, out of this world, I must have want more
Pyramids, Egypt-style, look like the Luxor
Dashiki wrapped on my face, though, I say so
Go anywhere the weight go for peso
Rosé tigre, connec' named Felipe
Nacho Libre, hood like Wee-Bey
Colombian necktie, respect and let the tech fly
Señor jefé, super-slime Aztec, ayy
Drink agua, lay up in Caguas
Still on my rah-rah, no Lady Gaga
Still, I rock the diamond holder
Mami give me brain, I think that she a mind controller
I don't mind her over
Stop one, corner store crime, I'm on top of it
Them dudes is washed, I'm exact opposite
I'ma live the dream, yo, no time to sleep, yo
If you know what we know, y'all niggas finito
Oh, it's an animal anthem
Oh, it's an animal anthem
Looking through the peephole, I can see the people
Looking for the heat, yo, y'all niggas finito
Oh, it's an animal anthem
Oh, it's an animal anthem

What's poppin', poppin'
Yeah, the spot is (Poppin', poppin')
Yeah, my knot is (Poppin', poppin')
My Glock is (Poppin', poppin')
So provocative3Embed
