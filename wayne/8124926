3 ContributorsI’m So Paid (Clean)  Lyrics
Rubbing on that Italian leather
Them Konvict jeans on
Eh yo Weezy, you ready?
Yeah
Yeah
Geah!

I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
I'm so paid

I see police on that crooked-I
Doing a hundred on Interstate 95
My shawty leaning, blasting that Do or Die
Wishing that a --- would, ‘cause we certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a --- under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hope they never call off
And thеm snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on mе
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
Rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than let them haters come and make a name off me
That's why...

I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy, yeah!)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
I'm so paid

I am the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off, that's all
(Guess what?) I won't be taking that fall
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm paying them for
Haha, ain't that funny?
Gorillas they want war but ain't got money
‘Cause I've seen them all talking until they start gunning
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing running
Yeah, Akon, Weezy (Jeezy!)
Black Royals holdin' down Jersey (Jersey)
Devine making sure we getting it up front
My little brother Bu got that vision, baby

I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid (Yeah)
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
I'm so paid (Sheesh!)
Ah-em, Big Money Weezy
White wife-beater --- underneath it
How do I feel? ---, I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct, yeah
I'm ballin', we ball out
Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce
I send some --- to y'all house
Only to find out you live in a dollhouse, ---!
But I thought you was tough, though
We carry choppers on our necks; call it "cutthroat"
We bury cowards on the set that they come from
We know magic, turn --- smoke to gun smoke
We! Bomb first when we ride
You! In a hearse when you ride (Ayy, ayy)
I put my shoe down, baby
And I'm holding down Young Mula, baby
That's why...

I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
I'm so paidEmbed
