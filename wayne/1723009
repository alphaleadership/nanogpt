I love the way you look
I love the way you smell
I love it when you grind it on me shawty can't you tell
You pop that pussy well
That nigga must be crazy
I roll in it for hours
Lil pimpin must be lazy
He like to disrespect ya, he got ya contemplatin'
I'll never disrespect ya, I'll compliment ya daily
Put ya in that new mercedes, i know that sucka hatin
Look let me upgrade ya, so he can really hate me
How you been feeling lately, since you let that busta loose
He put his hands on ya, he let ya see the truth
I put that ice around ya arm and let ya see the proof
So put that sucka to the side and let this nigga thru
So what ya need to do, is lose the dead weight
And let me do ya like the chorus of this song say
Or better yet just let me treat ya like my favorite dish
Before I eat ya I'll blow the candles out and make a wish

You'll barely spend a dollar, I'll blow it all on prada
Long as you treat me proper, it's all on me lil mama
Just let me be your doctor, promise I'll cut with caution
Just like old milk i'll spoil ya, spoil you until you rotten
Look how he treat you shawty, treat you like he don't need you
I need you really shawty, need you like I need jesus
Open up your ears up for me, so you can hear me clearly
It don't take much to feel me, especially when your heart is empty
You say he hate ya guts, girl I wanna get up in em
Love how you wear that denim, make me wanna bust up in ya
Look ya hear me just pretending, i'm trying to keep it trill
You messing wit a winner, so tell that nigga chill
Put you on ice for real, lace you from neck to ear
Take you and make you mine, you take me and make me yours
He used excessive force, i'll let the passion flow
No need for searching for love, i'm what your looking for

He like to hand cuff ya, i let ya cuffs loose
He skim the top layer, i go deep in ya roots
He like ya in the bed, i like ya on the roof
In the back seat of the coupe, i can make that pussy poop
He hit it old fashioned, I do's it brand new
If he aint working for ya, then bring ya man's thru
You know I whip it hard, hit it hit it after dark
Beat it like ya stole something, park my bus in your garage
I'm just trying to get in where I fit in, inside of your heart
If you accept me and you let me I'm playing my part
If you reject me and forget me you taking a loss
You wanna ride wit a scrub or roll wit a boss
Cuz i'm not trying to sweat ya, i'm trying to treat ya better
If you settle for him shawty you settle for lesser
And I'm of greater value, something like a hidden treasure
He put the B in Busta, I put the P in Pleasure

Shawty say the nigga that she wit aint shit
Shawty say the nigga that she wit aint this
Shawty say the nigga that she wit can't hit
Shawty i'm a hit it hit it like I can't missEmbed
