16 ContributorsBring It Back Lyrics
Yeah, brr, brr
Yeah (Oh), CMB (Oh, all the time), always, young digits, blatt, just like that

How come gettin' money never gets boring
How come gettin' money never gets boring
Baby, I gotta stack, now what you gonna do for it?
Can you bring it back like the motherfucking chorus

Can you bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Can you bring it back, back, back, back, back like a motherfucking chorus

Yeah, yeah, back on my set
Tool in my hand
Big money was the plan
So I’m back where I started
Back where it come from
Back where we went with it
Third ward soldier out the Phantom doing big business
Situations thick you got the homie toting two two’s
Comin back old school
Did it like he want to
Headed to the pen now he back up on the slab
Big money of the ab
Hundred G’s in cash
Brand new whip, old school Caddy
The dump truck, a stash spot
Then came up, it's more ones nigga
Versace sheets
Serve, is more money in the new fleet
You might also like
How come gettin' money never gets boring
How come gettin' money never gets boring
Baby, I gotta stack, now what you gonna do for it?
Can you bring it back like the motherfucking chorus

Can you bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Can you bring it back, back, back, back, back like a motherfucking chorus

Bought a new Phantom
Suede with the gators
Brand new Louis always ready to spray it
Like father like son
Money is a must
These hoes we don’t trust
Brand new trucks
Shined every summer
Ran with the numbers
Stash spot cool got a fifteen piece humming
Back up on my saddle nigga hustle for my shine
Just an ordinary nigga on a million dollar grind
Big timer old school, new school nigga
Is mo' money homie
Mo' money, mo' money mo' money homie
My bitches paid Cavalli Shades
Blowin haze, everyday
How come gettin' money never gets boring
How come gettin' money never gets boring
Baby, I gotta stack, now what you gonna do for it?
Can you bring it back like the motherfucking chorus

Can you bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Can you bring it back, back, back, back, back like a motherfucking chorus

Flip another hundred, get another hundred
Spend another hundred, burn another hundred
Blow another hundred, fuck another hundred
Get big money nigga, stuntin' on a hundred
Fifteen whips extra clips did it for the sunshine
Garbage bag full hard body with a fireline
Flip another brick, drink a little dip
Stunna Island nigga shinin' with a bad bitch
AR nigga, riding skinny tires
Fully loaded high when you floatin' in the sky
Rockin' Gucci blades, ridin' triple blades
Tats on the face, a nigga's been paid

How come gettin' money never gets boring
How come gettin' money never gets boring
Baby, I gotta stack, now what you gonna do for it?
Can you bring it back like the motherfucking chorus
Can you bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Can you bring it back, back, back, back, back like a motherfucking chorusEmbed
