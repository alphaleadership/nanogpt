4 ContributorsLights Low Lyrics
She say, "Turn the lights off"
I'm like, "No," haha
This is, this is
2 Pistols, Young Joe
I like my lights low

Lights down low (Low), nice and slow (Slow)
I'ma give your body what it's fiendin' for
Lights down low (Low), I'm a pro (Pro)
Ain't no limitations when this love unfolds
Wanna do you over here, do you over there
Don't tell nobody the freaky moments that we share
The lights down (Low, low, low, low, low, low)
The lights down (Low, low, low, low, low, low)
The lights down low

I took a glance at the Mueller, it said 2:30 (Thirty)
DJ screamin', "Last call," vision blurry (Blurry)
She say she gone get freaky as I want her to be (Be)
So I took her home, in the Rover with me (Me), we blowin' on trees (Trees)
Down 275, shawty wide open (Open)
Goose got her loose, I reach down, she soakin' (She soakin')
Wet for daddy, can I help you with that, shawty? (Huh?)
We at the mansion now, tongues touch, caressin' her body (Body)
Protection (What's next?), I'm feelin' her (Yes)
I know she feelin' me, where we goin'? Ecstasy (Oh yeah)
I'm a beast with them lights down low
Multiple positions and la-la-la-la-lickin' for sure
You might also like
Lights down low (Low), nice and slow (Slow)
I'ma give your body what it's fiendin' for
Lights down low (Low), I'm a pro (Pro)
Ain't no limitations when this love unfolds
Wanna do you over here, do you over there
Don't tell nobody the freaky moments that we share
The lights down (Low, low, low, low, low, low)
The lights down (Low, low, low, low, low, low)

Wanna do you over here
Lights down (Low, low, low)
Do you over there
Lights down (Low, low, low)
Lights down low

Lights down, face down, you know what's up
Just love makin', nah, baby, we don't f— (None of that)
What's that? Leave that to them lames
We be poppin' champagne, strawberries and whip cream (Cream)
No friends to intervene, private things, wildest dreams come true (True)
(Nah) It ain't no limits to the things that we do (Do)
Come closer, I bet I work you like a 9 to 5
If she’s not satisfied, I’ll put in overtime
From behind, smack, smack, she say that's mine (Who that?)
Body like a goddess, angel face, so you know shorty ain't never lie (Oh yeah)
I'm a beast with them lights down low
Multiple positions and la-la-la-la-lickin' for sure
Lights down low (Low), nice and slow (Slow)
I'ma give your body what it's fiendin' for
Lights down low (Low), I'm a pro (Pro)
Ain't no limitations when this love unfolds
Wanna do you over here, do you over there
Don't tell nobody the freaky moments that we share
The lights down (Low, low, low, low, low, low)
The lights down (Low, low, low, low, low, low)
The lights down low (Ya dig?)

I got her mouth wide open (Yeah), I'm inside, strokin' (Stroke)
She can't sit down, I her insides swollen (God)
She pick me, I'm chosen (Ayy), she stickin', I'm rollin' (Roll)
Say I'm movin' fast, but I beat it (Slow motion, slow)
Lights down low (Low), bed to the floor (Floor)
Kitchen to the shower, sleep a hour, need more (Now)
This what you fiend for, girl, you with it, admit it, want me to split it (Yeah)
Forget it's the first date, I'm C-Ride
Wait 'til you see my (Ayy) deep in your stomach
Get your face out my pillow, you can see when I'm comin' (Woo)
Y'all **** quit cuffin' (Quit), I'm who your chick lovin' (Need)
I keep a Superbad chick, Rizzle McLovin down low

Low (Low), nice and slow (Slow)
I'ma give your body what it's fiendin' for
Lights down low (Low), I'm a pro (Pro)
Ain't no limitations when this love unfolds
Wanna do you over here
Lights down (Low, low, low)
Do you over there
Lights down (Low, low, low)
