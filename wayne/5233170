Ayo, Tory!
I told you we was gon' do the remix, nigga
Alright, cool
Got it on smash
Easy Stevie, easy

Talk to me, baby (Talk)
You’s a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let ’em drop to the floor, oh

Talk to me, baby (Talk)
Work it, take the shift off for me, baby (Alright)
I drive the whip you bought for me, baby (Brr)
You know I got a lotta opps on me, baby
I whip around the corner in the whip (Whip)
Shout out Rafaello, man I love the drip, drip (Drip, drip)
80 pointers on my wrist (Ooh)
I'm hella rich and I love to talk shit, so

Girl, I'll race you to the floor, tell her go
Tell the crew, I got money, I'm the one you wanna know

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Talk to me, baby, talk to me, talk to me
Say it’s all for me, then get on, then get off of me
That is all for me, ain’t got no more love to offer me
Watch your tone for me, how you talk to me, softly
You gon' touch yourself, get off for me
What you want from me? Got your thoughts running
Heart pumping, and your skull jumping
You gon’ fall for me, you gon' cut a bitch and brawl for me
Whole bunch of missed calls from me, that's withdrawal, honey
Let that nigga give you mall money, it won't solve nothing
I take you shopping in all countries, buy your dog something
When you go topless in drawers for me, look like art to me
The way you sound when you talk to me, sound like harmony
Talk to me
Talk to me, baby (Talk to me)
You’s a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Talk to me)

New two-seater , two new divas
Know who to greet when I need some brand new weed, it's two new reefers
Know who to see when I need some brand new freaks
It's two new skeezers right there
Pop up on ya like, yeah
Buzzing like I'm Lightyear
Ain't see me in a light-year

She got good head (Head) and she eat her cornbread (Cornbread)

The pussy official, I fuck her one time and her face in a pillow
It's a one night ting, my diamonds fighting
This not no Breitling, that pussy biting

The plug gon' walk with me (Plug)
Ooh, she bougie, she busy (Busy)
Fuck it, might buy her a Bentley (Bentley, fuck it)
