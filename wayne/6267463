28 ContributorsBig Tipper Lyrics
Everything Foreign
Yessir
Woo
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Ayy, ayy

Bitch, I'm a big tipper
And you a big stripper
And I won't fuck a bitch unless she got a bitch with her
I Goyard, ho, look at the big zipper
Bitch, I'm a star, ho, just like the Big Dipper

I got 10 times, I fucked her 10 times
Lil' bitch, I told you I ain't paying for the 10th time
I go to Brooklyn and I fuck a bitch from Bedstuy
Can't fuck no bitch that be burning, this ain't no Left Eye
She got a boyfriend, but she don't love that nigga
She in my section drinking bottles saying, "Fuck that nigga"
He talking silly, let my shooter come and dust that nigga
His bitch was lookin' wonderin' why she even cuffed that nigga
Bitch, I can't fuck you, that pussy risk-ayy
But you been throwing it at me just like a frisb-ayy
Don't you evеr call yourself tryna diss me
You been on my dick since thе 10th grade
Look back at it, look full time
I been swimming on that pussy like the poolside
She just wanna fuck me and have a good time
I just wanna hit that pussy like a bullseye
I got tick tock, I got money on me
So much hunnids in my pocket, isn't funny on me
On the road, doing shows they be coming to see
And I'ma stunt on you hoes that done fronted on me
I got a lot of loose bills in my wallet nigga
Think about it, homie, you can't name a hotter nigga
Every time I'm on the track it's like I shot a nigga
Rich as fuck, a million dollars is a dollar, nigga
You might also like
Look back at it, look back at it
Go ahead, put the pussy in a crackmatic
I'ma hit it like a nigga tryna cat-daddy
Girl, you know a nigga love when you look back at it

I look back at it, look back at it
I watch that nigga eat the booty like a crack addict
I tell him beat the pussy up 'cause it's problematic
I got him shooting up the club with his automatic
And I'm riding on that dick like a road trip
He gon' feel the circle getting tighter like a mosh pit
Any bitch could get it, back it up if you gon' talk shit
Ho, get off your knees 'cause you know that you can't top this
It's a lot of blue bills in my wallet, nigga
Think about it, shorty, you can't even name a hotter nigga
Know I'm from the hood, I ain't playin' 'bout my guala, nigga
'Cause a million dollars just a dollar to a Harlem nigga
Yes indeed, he be trippin' 'cause that pussy slippery
He could barely believe it, you'd think that shit was Ripley’s
If he hitting me, he ain't dipping out, ain't quick to leave
He had to back up, ain't no Colin Kaepernick, he took a knee
Took the G5 straight to VLive
I done made it out the city like Diddy I'm screen-sized
These fly bitches only be hating and these guys, these lies
That these bitches be telling are flea-sized
Look back at it (Yeah), look back at it (Yeah)
Go ahead, put that pussy in a crackmatic (Ooh)
I'ma hit it like a nigga tryna cat-daddy (Oh)
Girl, you know a nigga love when you look back at it (Oh)

Look back at it, she got a fat fatty
She got her ass tatted, she just got more ass added
She got her pants sagging, and I'm a crack addict
That pussy glass house, she get her glass shattered
She say "Don't shoot cash at me, yo just Cash App me"
She make the pussy lips pout like it's mad at me
I'm a bad bunny, fuck you like you're Babs Bunny
Throw 50k at your face, that's just gas money
All the strippers love me, big tipper
I got strippers tippin' strippers for me
Big titties, if I listen they gon' pillow talk me
I'ma hit it then we practice social distance, homie
Lap dance while a pistol on me

Bitch, I'm a big tipper (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you a big stripper
And I won't fuck a bitch unless she got a bitch with her
I Goyard, ho, look at the big zipper
Bitch, I'm a star, ho, just like the Big Dipper (Yeah)
Look back at it (Yeah), look back at it (Yeah)
Go ahead, put that pussy in a crackmatic (Oh)
I'ma hit it like a nigga tryna cat-daddy (Oh)
Girl, you know a nigga love when you look back at it

Girl, you know a nigga love it when you look back at it, yeah
Then go back at it
Girl, you know a nigga love when you look back at it
Yeah, we back at it3Embed
