9 ContributorsBout What Ever Lyrics
Fatigued up full of that dope ready for war
Me and Mark wit' K's tearing yo station up
Bangin' that kill, shooting at anythang that's chillin'
Wit a hundred rounds, so you know there's gonna be a killin'
Better stay concealed in a place where we canâ€™t see
Ramble at night, in the evenin' we creep
Bout whateva nigga, killin' niggas like a season
Duct tape, body snatchin' niggas for any reasons
You best believe we real, we too hot and hard to kill
Nuts hang low as they could, we get it how we live
Turn the game spittin' stainin' witnesses and all
Ain't no escapin' choppers gone set it off
Lil Wayne 'bout that funky shit
Leave nigga fire if out of line get rid of quick
The Magnolia is where I be
Where them soulja's will leave a nigga stankin', missin' for weeks

'Bout whateva you 'bout, whateva you want we can do it
Triggas I yank and yo station I'ma run through it
'Bout whateva you 'bout, nigga all day and all night
Look here man I ain't scared to lose my life
'Bout whateva you 'bout, whateva you want we can do it
Triggas I yank and yo station I'ma run through it
'Bout whateva you 'bout, nigga all day and all night
Look here man I ain't scared to lose my life
You might also like
The young head busta, eliminating niggas like nothin'
Fifty shots I release, hit yo block, head bustin'
Turk and Wayne the youngest of the squad with the ride
Magnolia I represent 'til I die, that's no lie
Infered beams, chest headshots I'm givin'
Bullets flippin' and still but nothing but gun smoke when you slippin'
And yo body hot like shit you drop nigga
Hit yo block in the jag wit' the top dropped nigga
Soulja rags wit' black bows I thugged out
Times a Hot Boy wit' two slugs in my mouth
Before five we cocked back always ready for beef
Still got niggas on my side who gone ride wit' me
I hope you bout what I'm bout 'cause if not ya all in
I be in shitty colors A-K six and ten
No hesitation in my bloodline
Killin' niggas still no thang and I put it on yo mind

'Bout whateva you 'bout, whateva you want we can do it
Triggas I yank and yo station I'ma run through it
'Bout whateva you 'bout, nigga all day and all night
Look here man I ain't scared to lose my life
'Bout whateva you 'bout, whateva you want we can do it
Triggas I yank and yo station I'ma run through it
'Bout whateva you 'bout, nigga all day and all night
Look here man I ain't scared to lose my life
I let'em sag, strap wit' automatics fully loaded
Gloc's wit' 17 for the haters is why I tote it, never loaded
I'm sobber nigga I stay on my shit
Nigga want beef wit' me, I, he jack on that bitch
Bout that druggin' 17 nigga I'm thuggin'
Nigga disrespect me get licked out like a rug and
I discharge like a hoe
Nigga fall like ceaser to the morge is where they go
I ain't no hoe for you niggas that don't know
I pack the A-K and the fuckin' .44, I let'em flow
You get hit, you crapped out
Headshots, that's what I'm givin' brains be all out
You family fall out when they hear about you
I release, release the whole clip not few
Nigga you through when you fuckin wit' me
Lil Turk the H-B from the U-P-T

'Bout whateva you 'bout, whateva you want we can do it
Triggas I yank and yo station I'ma run through it
'Bout whateva you 'bout, nigga all day and all night
Look here man I ain't scared to lose my life
'Bout whateva you 'bout, whateva you want we can do it
Triggas I yank and yo station I'ma run through it
'Bout whateva you 'bout, nigga all day and all night
Look here man I ain't scared to lose my life
'Bout whateva you 'bout, whateva you want we can do it
Triggas I yank and yo station I'ma run through it
'Bout whateva you 'bout, nigga all day and all night
Look here man I ain't scared to lose my life
