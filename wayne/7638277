2 ContributorsTake Me Higher Lyrics
(T-Take you a lil’ bit higher)
Snort a line off a hoe, that’s a body blow
Snort a line off a hoe, that’s a body blow
Habit on the low
(T-Take you a lil’ bit higher)

Uh
I’m sellin’ cocaine by the elevator
Tell ‘em get on this cocaine, not the elevator
Always workin’, never broke, like the elevator
Hope your high come down slow, stop on every floor
I been sellin’ top shelf since a seventh grader
Make them Cookie Monsters pay for this vanilla wafеr
I say get on this cocaine and not this elеvator
‘Cause I can take you higher than your destination
(T-Take you a lil’ bit higher)
I ain’t got no freebies, I don’t do no favors
I don’t smoke no papers, I don’t smoke no vapor
Hear me coughin’, better not hear you coughin’ up no data
What happens at this elevator stays here like Las Vegas
Shout out my amigo, he owe me a hundred favors
So he’ll kill for me, save me the fuckin’ labor
I got Vanilla Ice, I got white chocolate, I got every flavor
Even Ray Rice couldn’t beat my price, at this elevator, no
You might also like
I’m sellin’ cocaine by the elevator
They rather get on this cocaine, not the elevator
(T-Take you a lil’ bit higher)
Always workin’, never broke, like the elevator
I take you higher
(T-Take you a lil’ bit higher)

I been sellin’ Grade A since a seventh grader
Sold it to my teachers, got an A on every paper
Hope your high come down slow like a escalator
Take the stairway to heaven not the elevator
Shout out my amigo, he owe me a hundred favors
He’ll kill for me, I call him the undertaker
Not another seizure, no, I’m shakin’ off the haters
Tell ‘em I can take you higher, you can’t pay me later, no

I’m sellin’ cocaine by the elevator
(I’m sellin’ cocaine! Ooh)
They rather get on this cocaine, not the elevator
(Tell ‘em get on this cocaine! Ooh)
Always workin’, never broke, like the elevator
(I’m always workin’, never broke)
I take you higher
I take you a lil’ bit higher, ooh yeah
I’m sellin’ cocaine by the elevator
(I’m sellin’ cocaine! Ooh)
Get on this cocaine, not the elevator
(I tell ‘em get on this cocaine!)
Snort a line off a hoe, that’s a body blow
Always workin’, never broke, like the elevator
Snort a line off a hoe, that’s a body blow
I take you a lil’ bit higher, ooh yeah

I’m the fat Busta Rhymes, I can flip modes
Word on the street that we hot but the jet cold
Up in this bitch gettin’ higher, let’s go
Out of town, out of state, out the country, I don’t know
Only thing I know, we ain’t  never out of money though
Only thing I love is a bitch nobody know
That’s nobody, so I love nobody hoe
Bitches on coke, lickin’ dope with a snotty nose
I’ma hit a line get to takin’ everybody hoe
Matter fact, I’ma just smoke, where the fuckin’ dro
Matter fact, let me smell the coke, let me smell the coke, you should smell the coke
Bring ya girl, put it down ya throat
Snort a line off a hoe, that’s a body blow
Habit on the low, cocaine in the lobby hoe
Really got these women on fire
(T-Take you a lil’ bit higher)
I’m sellin’ cocaine by this elevator
C’mon get on this cocaine, not this elevator
(T-Take you a lil’ bit higher)
Shout out my amigo, he owe me a hundred favors
I hope your high come down slow, stop on every floor
I got every flavor, I’m still by that elevator
I can take you higher, you could thank me later
I got every flavor, I’m still by that elevator
Even Ray Rice couldn’t beat my price, at this elevator, no

I’m sellin’ cocaine by the elevator
(I’m sellin’ cocaine! Ooh)
They rather get on this cocaine, not the elevator
(Tell ‘em get on this cocaine! Ooh)
Always workin’, never broke, like the elevator
(I’m always workin’, never broke)
I take you higher
I take you a lil’ bit higher, ooh yeah

I’m sellin’ cocaine by the elevator
(I’m sellin’ cocaine! Ooh)
They rather get on this cocaine, not the elevator
(Tell ‘em get on this cocaine! Ooh)
Always workin’, never broke, like the elevator
(I’m always workin’, never broke)
I take you higher
I take you a lil’ bit higher, ooh yeahEmbed
