Rich Gang

It's official, the whistle blowin', the liquor pourin'
We had our issues and differences, we were sick of warring
City nigga, you think I been out of chicken form?
Plenty bitches but really never committed to 'em
Anything my lil' pretty things want, I get it for 'em (What you want?)
These niggas tricky, these bitches ain't got no feelings for 'em
You hear the crickets and birds chirping, that's paradise
Penthouse we don't reserve, we dine in candlelight
Don't like that lying shit, I'm the one they confide wit'
Victoria's Secret, a secret garden, quit hiding shit (Quit hiding shit)
I provide shit, have you in all that fly shit (Fly shit)
So much shit, you done run out of room in your closet (Closet)
You want that Nicki, that Mary J, that Mariah shit (What you want?)
That Halle Berry, that Angelina, Sanaa shit
Desire shit, ain't no side niggas or side chicks (Us)
They on that my shit, we on that you and I shit

Now ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick ho
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that, ride that
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick ho (Rich)
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that, ride that
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick ho (Out the pound wit' it)
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that, ride that (We up top in Seattle)
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick ho (Just like that)
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick
You might also like
Stuntin' all with the power, got the chopper in hand
Filthy bitches 'bout the money, Alexander the fan
Big paper, one side, kept me one in the hand
Real niggas know the rule, we'll kill for them bands
Heads on, on Claiborne, hit 'em and we move on
That's the way we did it, nigga, spread then we get gone
Lil' Mama know we did it but she lived and she stay strong
A hunnid keys, so we flip it and we move on
Back in the Three and we did it in and laced on
Lil' nigga may give his life for paid on
Bills with the caddies nigga, get in my way homie
Back 'bout the money so we had to spray homie

Now ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick ho
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that, ride that (Yeah)
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick ho
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that, ride that
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick ho
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that, ride that
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick ho
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick

Ride this dick, don't fall baby
Y'ain't sippin' lean like Paul Wall baby
Y'ain't earn the pussy, better be bald headed
Fat like Star Jones baby, got a nigga stargazing, oh baby

After that, prrp, hello, click, don't call a nigga back to back

'Cause all these thots will kill ya

She got that hallelujah

And she gon' ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick ho (Don't fall baby)
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that, ride that (Rich Gang)
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick ho
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that, ride that

Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that, ride that (Real Uptown shit)
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick ho
Ride it, ride it, ride, ride that dick
