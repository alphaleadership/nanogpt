Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low (Entertain us)
Hello, hello, hello, how low (Here we are now)
Hello, hello, hello, how low (Entertain us)
Hello, hello, hello, how low (I feel stupid)

My money bag heavy in every town I lock up (Woo)
Loafs of bread jumping out the toaster when I pop up (Yeah)
 because my stocks up
These bitches get their rocks up
When the dick poke their Facebook and fill their inbox up
You niggas full of shit like toilets when they stopped up
That's when I let your chick come through and lick my lollipop up
Yeah, there ain't no need to call the doc' up
I kill you niggas quick, somebody need to call the cops up
The streets is my vagina how I always fuck the blocks up
I'm always in the kitchen, I don't ever put the pots up
Regardless what you feel, it's the god paradoxed up
Like you deserve the right and we should motherfuckin' swap up
Witness the god of the bouncing of hands
My niggas know I'ma blow and hit 'em
And I hang 'em and you know I'ma go and I'ma kill 'em
And I'm  in your seat the way y'all do it to the end
And I stop and then I come and then I go and then I kill a nigga
Ran up when I get up on the beat and then catch another 
And then I roll up on their ass like I'm whippin' in a Phantom
See the way a nigga doin' it again!

Hello, hello, hello, how low (Entertain us)
Hello, hello, hello, how low (Here we are now)
Hello, hello, hello, how low (Entertain us)
Hello, hello, hello, how low (I feel stupid)

Swisher rolled tight, the clique roll tighter
I wave my red flag like a fucking bullfighter
Yeah, bitch, like the L Boogie
I've been around the world, there's no place like pussy (Yeah!)
Take one shot for my pain, one drink for my sorrow
I ain't doing well, bitch, I'm doing Wells Fargo
I get on the beat and leave the bitch bloody
Keep a hungry bitch with me that'll eat a bitch for me
You could blame it on the Wayne, it's all my fault
Bitch, I go hard, concrete sidewalk
Yeah, in Young Money we trust
You'd rather sleep with the enemy than sleep on us
I got the game in my hand, I'm playing keep away
Don't judge me, I'ma beat the case
Yeah, big hall, blue lights
Big dog, roofs twice
I'm the crap, two dice, Tunechi
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low (Entertain us)
Hello, hello, hello, how low (Here we are now)
Hello, hello, hello, how low (Entertain us)
Hello, hello, hello, how low (I feel stupid)1Embed
