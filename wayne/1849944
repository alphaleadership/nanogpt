5 ContributorsExecution Style Lyrics
Hey, yo I don't give a fuck who with 'em
I want 'em all dead
Let the mack eleven conversate with his forehead
I wanna see your thoughts splattas
Bitch I put this uzi in ya mouth
And squeeze the trigger like a fat ass
Shoot 'em in the fucking face
Chainsaw 'em down
Streets tell 'em what it is
"execution style"
Layin' chest down, Broke his arms
Get his dome too
Guess I'll see ya next life time like "buy-do"
I decorate your fucking outfit with red dots
No photographers in here
But we specialize in head shots
Jae won't miss ya
Mister I'm like Adolf Hitler
Nigga I'll Schindler's List ya
Goodnight I'll let the AK long kiss ya
Murder all ya loved ones but no one will miss ya
'course I got murder money
Like Griselda Blanco
Lay a nigga down pronto, execution style
You might also like
I ain't grow up soft
I grew up wild
Neva gave a fuck, and I don't give a fuck now
Bitch nigga play me wrong
And I'ma shoot 'em down
Kill his whole motherfuckin' family
Execution style

I ain't grow up soft
I grew up wild
Neva gave a fuck, and I don't give a fuck now
Bitch nigga play me wrong
And I'ma shoot 'em down
Kill his whole motherfuckin' family
Execution style

2 clickers pointed at cha 6 pack
Click, clack
Turn this motherfucka to a rib shack
Exit wounds to the back of ya head
Put the pillow on the barrel
Catch you nappin' in bed
Execution is no resolution
21 gun salute, revolution
I could getcha brains for the low
Like I got it from a booster
You pussy in the gun, gonna douche ya
Catch you waking up while you yawning
The nine with the beam
Rise and shine, good mornin'
Spaghetti on ya garments
Pasta your posture
Cook 'em like a foreman
Crack 'em like a lobster
Pop star, mop 'em
Stand on top of 'em
Point blank range till ya not
Then I pop 'em
Rock 'em, drop 'em
Two hallow tips to ya noggin
Kill 'em execution style
Nigga no problem
I ain't grow up soft
I grew up wild
Neva gave a fuck, and I don't give a fuck now
Bitch nigga play me wrong
And I'ma shoot 'em down
Kill his whole motherfuckin' family
Execution style

I ain't grow up soft
I grew up wild
Neva gave a fuck, and I don't give a fuck now
Bitch nigga play me wrong
And ima shoot 'em down
Kill his whole motherfuckin' family
Execution style

Somebody, Nobody, Yo Buddy
Nail your head with nobody
Oh I didn't wanna step to me
I'm from the home of the steppers
And no one take time out
I'm like New Orleans like weather
Every so devious, mean and mischievous
We all gotta eat
And I'm the motherfuckin' greediest
Check my previous, I'm the hardest
They the easiest
They wanna know what Weezy is
And what kinda disease he is
I can't be cured, ya can't cure
Gotta scope and a red beam for when I ain't sure
Peek-a-boo mutherfucka I see ya
You a pussy
And I would love to be Gonorrhea
Straight run up in your casa tie up mama-mia
Let her getchu on the phone
Gun will hurt of the ear
I ain't playing right now
No not right now
I'll shot you in your muthafukin smile
Hahaha
I ain't grow up soft
I grew up wild
Neva gave a fuck, and I don't give a fuck now
Bitch nigga play me wrong
And I'ma shoot 'em down
Kill his whole motherfuckin' family
Execution style

I ain't come up soft
I came up wild
Neva gave a fuck, and I don't give a fuck now
Bitch nigga trynna play me
And I'ma shoot 'em down
Kill his whole motherfuckin' family
Execution styleEmbed
