I push myself, I push myself
I asked you twice, let me slow down
I push myself, why can't you tell?
I'm at my breaking point right now, and

What more do you want from me?
Cause I just want honesty
I'm doing my best, believe me, oh na na yah yah
What more do I gotta do?
Yeah, I risk it all for you
And I know you know you need me, oh na na yah yah

Got no sleep, so I
Started sipping something just to ease my mind
Look at me, I'm tired
Still every day and every night, night, night

I-I-I-I push myself, I-I push myself
I-I asked you twice, let, let me slow down
I-I push myself, why can't you tell?
I'm at my breaking point right now, and

I'm at my breaking point, I got 99 problems, Jay-z voice, uh
I'm moving way too fast, I've been trying to slow down
But my break's destroyed
I just might fade away, I do not get my head away, But my head away, yeah
It's all in my head okay, I might fall hit my head, okay
But my head okay
I need to medicate, I'm getting so red in the face
And I'm jagged face
I hear they get maded face, all I do is stay away, no bedroom made
Got no sleep, I'm so weak, 5 4 3, don't count on me
Cause I'm so geed, IOD, all that OP I OD
Pshh

Got no sleep,  (yeah) so I  (huh)
Started sipping something just to  ease my mind  (yeah)
Look at me  (yeah), I'm tired  (yeah)
Still every day and every night, night, night  (I push myself)

I-I-I-I push myself  (I push myself) , I-I push myself   (I push myself)
I-I asked you twice, let, let me slow down  (I asked you twice, let me slow down)
I-I push myself   (I push myself) , why can't you tell?  (can't you tell?)
I'm at my breaking point right now, and  (I'm at my breaking point right now)
I push myself, I-I push myself   (I push myself)
I-I asked you twice   (I push myself) , let-let me slow down   (I asked you twice, let me slow down)

I'm at my breaking point right now and1Embed
