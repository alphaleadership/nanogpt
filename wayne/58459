29 ContributorsSo Good Lyrics
Cool N Dre

Uh, pull up on ‘em bitches, get out, walk
Way to many holes, like I play golf
She’s somewhere in Wayne’s world, stranded, lost
Bitch catchin' feelin’s like Randy, Moss
Young Money shit, got the bathroom door locked
Tune go hard, y’all softer than my car top
Hank Gathers, I’ma ball til my heart stop
Nice red bone in a thong and a bra top
Lookin' for a queen from a king-size bed
I can make that pussy stand up and drop dead
Fuckin’ with Lil Tune then a nigga get murked
A nigga get kilt like a muthafuckin' skirt
I do it like Nike, I’m psychic I knew you like it
Run up in ya ass, than I dash like a hyphen
This is priceless, not for sale
And I unveil, Ms. Shanell

The feeling of your arms around me
I swear that I can’t get enough
I’m staying up all night
Wishing you were here with me
And when I’m with my girls
They're trippin’ cause it won’t be long
Before you have me rushing home, 'cause
You might also like
Boy you’re everything I need
I don’t wanna see you leave
I got time if you got me
Don’t you know you make it feel
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
Soooo gooood

And when you're gone too long
I’m waiting with your T-shirt on
Playing love songs
The closer I get to you (Yeah)
You make me feel good
You tell me love is crazy (Yeah)
I guess that we are too (Young Money)
There ain't a thing I won’t do
To prove that I’ll be here for you, oh (Oh yeah)

You know I wake up like a king, get up, stunt
Take advantage of the day, this shit won't happen more than once
Know I’m ready for whatever, ready for the action
I’m still focused on my shit, but, girl, I’m up for a distraction
Got a body like a stripper, but tell me she a student
But some strippers are students, so I tell her ass to prove it
You know, yeah show me all your books and some ID or somethin'
I just wanna know that you can teach me somethin'
Boy you’re everything I need
I don’t wanna see you leave
I got time if you got me
Don’t you know you make it feel
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
Soooo gooood

Baby our song is on the radio
Our song is on the radio (Yeah)
Our song is on the radio (So turn it up)
Turn it up on your stereo (So turn it up)
'Cause I'm dedicating this to you (Yeah)
Baby our song is on the radio (I'm dedicatin' this to you)
Our song is on the radio (So turn it up)
Turn it up on your stereo (Young)
'Cause I'm dedicating this to you (Young Moolah, baby)

Boy you’re everything I need (Yeah, go)
I don’t wanna see you leave (Yeah)
I got time if you got me (Yeah)
Don’t you know you make it feel (You make me)
So good, good, good (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
So good, good, good (Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah)
So good, good, good (SnL)
Soooo gooood, yeah (Young Moolah, baby, Young Drizzy, hahaha)
(Yeah, ladies & gentlemen, I give you the beautiful Ms. Shanell)4Embed
