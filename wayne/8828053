Let’s go nigga
This the one right here
Queen in this shit
Let’s get em’

You’re inspired, you’re a fan
What can you not comprehend?
Do I really gotta dumb for you just for
You to understand?
Crown still ain’t slip, suck my dick
Running the game like Sonic bitch
Pull my dick out how bout’ you ride it
Cause that’s what you known for bitch
Bitch you ugly even with surgery
Got them “awards” but still ain’t in front me…You might also likeEmbed
