17 ContributorsLil Romeo Lyrics
Mink Miu Miu boots got me tip toeing
Leather sweatpants, that's Rick Owens
Skinny so the blick showing
Semi with the dick showing
Private 757 big Boeing
Tell my pilot I say "Get going"
Yellow bone with me, skin glowing
Of course her friend join
They do what I say, they be 10-4'in and ain't no Venmo'in
Light the J like I be Leno'in, the bae I'm ignoring
Blow the paper like a vent blowing, just like some lint blowing
It's Tunechio Clericuzio kitchen in the studio
Soft top double R, that's the Ricky Rubio
Beautiful diamonds dancing likе they're in a musical
Optical illusional, Jordan pharmaceuticals

Ooh yеah wait, fuck is my lighter?
Ooh wait mmm yeah, uh

And that's Lil T on the audio, uh
We like Luigi and Mario, uh
Every bar be like a bar of soap, uh
Every flow be like a marble floor, uh
Used to buy weed by the corner store, uh
Buy whole pounds of Master P, uh
I'm a roll me a Lil Romeo, wait
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
That chef boy'r T and he on the stove, yeah
We like Luigi and Mario, yeah
Every bar be like a bar of soap, yeah
Every flow be like a marble floor, yeah
We tote styrofoams and we comatose, yeah
I Buy a pound of some Master P, yeah
I'm a roll me a Lil Romeo, wait

Last night I had a fight with my sleep
I guess the coke got in my pores from touching all the bricks
So I just wrapped 'em up and wrote Tyson on each
I got 'em biting ears and biting their teeth
I'm talking 'bout that good snow, temp low
Don't be surprised if I sneeze
Excuse me, god bless me, thank you
Socks on the coupe cover the ankles
I'm driving so fast I might sprain 'em
They be tryna bite the style like a caiman
But we know it's all Wayne's, no Damon
Only God can judge me, Jesus piece on in my arraignment
Fuck you talkin' bout? Explain it
Dana Dane chains on, looking sweeter than a Danish
Painting pictures with his guts, artistic genius
I stand back and admire my art and kiss my fingers
And in God I trust, mwah
My nina say she wanna get her body done
Before I load the gun I told my bullets "All we got is us"
Lambi on blades, propellers, blunt long as Coachella
Mother knows best and daddy don't know no better
I know you smell him, it's Young Tunechi Coca
My uncle Rufus just OD'ed, we burning down the dope house
This shit calamitous, animals
And they all with the shit, unanimous
I'm sicker than an ambulance
I'm shittin' like a baby that got sick of all the pampering
She foreign, Yugoslavian
I throw this dick and she gon' act like I just threw a javelin
Ooh, wait, yeah yeah, uh
And that's Lil T on the audio, uh
We like Luigi and Mario, uh
Every bar be like a bar of soap, uh
Every flow be like a marble floor, uh
Used to buy weed by the corner store, uh
Buy whole pounds of Master P, uh
I'm a roll me a Lil Romeo, wait
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
That chef boy'r T and he on the stove, yeah
We like Luigi and Mario, yeah
Every bar be like a bar of soap, yeah
Every flow be like a marble floor, yeah
We tote styrofoams and we comatose, yeah
I buy a pound of some Master P, yeah
I'm a roll me a Lil Romeo, wait1Embed
