Squad Up!
Uh-oh
Ya bitch, you
This is sqad up (S-Q-A-D-U-P)
First nigga representin'
Young Weezy holla back

Every new hour is a new dollar
You keep drinkin' it, we keep makin' it
And we ain't livin' if we ain't takin' it
Trill as fuck, you ain't real if you ain't takin' it
Squad Up, if you ain't feelin' it then suck a dick
What up ma, if you feelin' us then suck a dick
We on some fuck-a-bitch, get back to ya hustle shit
And I'm like Jadakiss, we gon' make it
If not, shit, we gon' take it
I ride wit' the top split, be all bladed
In a neon 'Cedes, CD on Baby
Baby, yeah
I holla what up Sqadron
It's Weezy bitch, get fire hydrants
You see in a Bentley 6, him gone hard
Fuck inches, so from now on I be sittin' on yards
If you play I leave your fuckin' body sittin' on yards
Young Money, bitch, this our Sqad, Squad Up

Muhfucka, I'ma ride for nothin' but Sqad
Guns up to sky, I'm bustin' for Sqad
And I'm probably still high from puffin' the ly
And I'm probably murder niggas for servin' figures
I make you back that ass up when I twerk the trigger

Yea nigga Sqad Up
Third nigga representin'
Young Nut, let's holla

Peanut the sixth shooter, I'm a fool wit' that
Wit' a upper big rugger, come and blues ya set
Believe I can get to ya, blame ya boo for that
Got niggas hittin' they crew up and them dudes is back
Like who is that sittin' in the coupe wit' Fat?
Wit' uzi's and mac's, niggas don't know who gone next
We movin' in next, the whole block movin' in stacks
They losin' sacks, ya whole block should've been packed
I'm good wit' the mack, come on, stop pullin' me back
Gimmie the rack, I won't stop, my hood is Mazant
And Uncle Marcus say I'm a walkin' target
When it come to bein' gangsta, shit, I walk and talk it
Feds got me on they walkie talkie, puttin' charges on me
Actin' up cause I'm small and bony, call the army
Believe Sqad, a heartless army
We'll have ya ma' lone and moaning
It ain't game 'cause we....
