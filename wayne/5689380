1 ContributorMy Life (Scouse Remix) ft. Lil Wayne Lyrics
And I'm grindin till I'm tired cause they said
"You ain't grindin until you tired"
So I'm grindin with my eyes wide
Lookin to find, a way through the day
A light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin why
You haven't taken my life (my life, my life)
Like what the hell am I doin right?

It's like I've been here before, I've seen the way that I die
Avoid the pull or not I'm headed to the man in the sky
This isn't LA, this isn't Compton, it's not the ghetto
It's Liverpool where you hear the gunshots echo
And you can see your funeral in the Echo
But please don't forget that I've been here from the get go
(So let's roll!)
It's like this city don't wanna be real
They want gang wars, money out of drug deals
Now I'm no saint, I won't paint it like I am
Cause I'm involved in that shit, am I any less of a man?
(I don't think so!)
Cause I hold my own, never see me roll alone
Wear a bulletproof cause muppets wanna see me rolled in stone
I've never claimed to be a soldier of streets
I'm a man and don't agree with death over some beef
But you WILL take a slap if you step outta line
And I might wave a strap just to show you it's mine
You might also like
And I'm grindin till I'm tired cause they said
"You ain't grindin until you tired"
So I'm grindin with my eyes wide
Lookin to find, a way through the day
A light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin why
You haven't taken my life (my life, my life)
Like what the hell am I doin right?

And I might let it go just to show you it's real
And I might let you hold it just to prove that it's steel
Or you can take my advice and look after your life
And no I don't talk shit, it's true what I write
Cause I'm not one of those silly muppets, that talk about
Keeping guns in their ken, but don't know if you took it
Been around (been around)
Seen things but don't know it all
Cause the worst that you can be is a know-it-all
I know what I need to
Nah, I won't meet you
I ain't a stupid cunt so I'll see ya when I see ya
That's how I've always done it, nothin's gonna change now
Fresh outta jail tryna change round
Cause I gotta make money, that's my life
So keep your nose out and live yours
Don't listen to what I write
So do that, and we'll get along fine, kid
Fuck Game, tell em Wayne, my life's just a grind, kid!

And I'm grindin till I'm tired cause they said
"You ain't grindin until you tired"
So I'm grindin with my eyes wide
Lookin to find, a way through the day
A light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin why
You haven't taken my life (my life, my life)
Like what the hell am I doin right?
My life (my life, my life)
My life (my life, my life)
Dean! Didn't I tell em I'd be back?
Told em didn't I?
My life (my life, my life)
My life (my life, my life)
HA HA!Embed
