20 ContributorsOld Town Road (Lil Wayne Remix) Lyrics
Oh, oh-oh
Oh

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Uh, uh, I got the horses in the back, and she twerk it for a pony
Ooh, she got that honky-tonky, I met her on Farmers Only
I'm a Young Money cowboy, sitting on my high horse
Gucci cowboy boots, the snakeskin, ooh, the pythons
Pull up on a tractor, lean and Jolly Ranchers
Pop a couple perkies, chew 'em like beef jerky
Sticky weed is like a cactus
Aw man, quit jumblin' grown man
She ride me say, "Yeehaw", man
Call me Lil Jon Wayne

(Remix baby) Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Remix baby) I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more2Embed
