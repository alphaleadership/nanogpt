17 ContributorsLike Me (Remix) Lyrics
Never loved, never loved
Never loved another nigga like me
Cause she know I got that good wood
I wham and I bam and I juug-juug
She leave out my house on a good foot
I hit her ass up with that Worldstar
I Lollapalooza her good spot
She swallow the kids I say, "good God!"
Even though she'll make a good mom
She say she never met a met a good nigga
I say I never met a good cop
She suck on that dick like a Push Pop
She get mad as hell when I pull out
She knows that there's only one Tunechi
She be like "Weezy, I love Tunechi"
I be like baby, don't confuse me"
Then I play with that pussy like a Rubix
Between me and you she call me, "Sexy chocolate"
And I swear that pussy like fudge to me
She say, "Come over and come get it"
She say, "Cum on me, cum in me, cum through me"
Cause she ain't never been dicked down
She don't know how that feel
She ain't ever been licked down from her earrings to her heels, Lord
She ain't ever been in a big house
I gotta watch her so she don't steal
She ain't ever been with a millionaire
That's really one in a mil'â€”Tunechi!
