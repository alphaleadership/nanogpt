2 ContributorsWhen You’re Gone (Original Version) Lyrics
Shout out Dakari
Shout out Ash, shout out Jessie, shout out to Game
It’s like we always do it this time
Just take it to myself like, yeah, uh, uh

Starin’ at a blank canvas
Thinkin’ about what should I write, should I plan this?
Reminiscing 18, a freshman on campus
With dreams so big, nobody understands us
Till they came true, started goin’ bananas
Somewhere along the road, I got us as lost as Atlantis
Been there since Vegas, drinking under cabanas
And medicine for breakups, take the pills life hand us
No sleep, I been up for a couple of days
Can’t nobody talk to him, been stuck in my ways
They say it’s “unsustainable”, but fuck it, it pays
Results and results, keep runnin’ them plays
I see the writings on the wall, that shit’s gеtting clear
My new girl says she lovе me, but I don’t even hear her
I can’t even drive a Jag’, that shit is inferior
Only time I see a threat, when I look in the mirror

Yeah, they only love you (Ay) when you gone
It don’t matter where you goin’ (Uh), yeah (You know)
But I did it on my own
So I’d rather be alone, yeah (I’d rather be alone, uh)
They only love you when you’re gone
It don’t matter where you goin’ (Yeah), yeah (Uh)
But I got it on my own, so I’d rather die alone (Yeah)
See G-Eazy LiveGet tickets as low as $36You might also like
Yeah, the greatest gift is knowledge itself
They fail to talk about my journey with mission and wealth
I made it here all by my lonely, no askin’ for help
What if my debut never dropped and got kept up on a shelf
Uh, finna sour a grape slowly
A black leather, slicked back, they want the old G
“Things are happening again”, that’s what they told me
I came home, full circle, not as an OG
Blink my eyes to my surprise, I’m in Tokyo
20,000 in the crowd singing every quote
Blink again and they kickin’ me out of Canada
I swear you wouldn’t have the stomach or the stamina
Yeah, my shoulders carry over 20 tons
Biggie said there’s more problems when the money comes
My songs speak to the greats, hear the one-on-ones
I’mma go out as a legend when it’s said and done

Yeah, they only love you when you gone
It don’t matter where you goin’, (Where you goin’, uh) yeah
But I did it on my own (On my own)
So I’d rather be alone, yeah (I’d rather be alone, yeah)
They only love you when you’re gone (Yeah)
It don’t matter where you goin’, yeah
But I got it on my own, so I’d rather die alone
Yeah, they say fortune only favors the bold
Stacks so big, I can’t get this paper to fold
North Oakland, North Pole, we came from the cold
Solidify my legacy when my story is told
Yeah, spent a ticket on this new Dior
Fuck a hit, this shit is what I do it for
So these bars will always be apart of me
Right now, I feel like track 2 on Tha Carter III
Uh, like I’m 2008 Nola
This shit is bubblin’ and I don’t even drink soda
The whole industry was givin’ me a cold shoulder
And now my record label needs me to make quota
Uh, this all facts and every bar is real
In twenty years, pray to God I’m makin’ art still
I’m letting everything go like a yard sale
'Cause my songs will beat longer than my heart will, uh

Yeah, they only love you when you gone
It don’t matter where you goin’, yeah
But I did it on my own
So I’d rather be alone, yeah
They only love you when you’re gone
It don’t matter where you goin’, yeah
But I got it on my own, so I’d rather die alone
Yeah, who put this shit together? I put this shit together
I’mma wear all my chains like some Olympic medals
They think it’s all a game, so I’m thinking winning record
They think it Kurt Cobain, but I’m thinking living legend
I’m straight to the Hall Of Fame, straight from the hallways of the ghetto
It’s fuck the world, fuck 12, since I was like 10-11
I built the whole fucking mountain, I started out with a pebble
That money talk, that’s a convo
If you broke then that’s a lecture
I does me, cause only God can judge me
Nigga trust me, only I can trust me
Yeah it’s just me, and the skies above me
But I dug deep, now close your eyes and come see
Will they love me when I’m gone? Will they know me?
Do they love me when I’m home or when I’m O.T.?
I’m here, I don’t know how long before I won’t be
So when I’m gone, how long will they mourn me?

Yeah, they only love you when you gone
It don’t matter where you goin’, yeah
But I did it on my own
So I’d rather be alone, yeah
They only love you when you’re gone
It don’t matter where you goin’, yeah
But I got it on my own, so I’d rather die alone

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Eazy, Eazy
Mula
Yeah
They only love you when you…Embed
