30 ContributorsNew Shit Lyrics
Ugh! Flow gifted like the honor roll
In crunch time, I deliver like Domino's
A different freak for every day; I got all kind of hoes
I slide them dick and get the fuck out, never mind them hoes
But never mind them hoes, I got all kind of flows
I switch them up so quick as fuck, I got a timeless flow
Young animal, punishing the ProTools
Eating this beat up like soul food, you niggas old news

Now, ain’t you tired of seeing the same shit every day?
I mean, the same shit—Ashley and Mary Kate
Sometimes, I wish that I was blind like Mr. Ray
How come you talking out your ass but ain’t got shit to say?
I spend my money like my time; I ain’t got it to waste
Man, I'm so fast, feel like I'm racing in a different race
Too much champagne, now, watch me spit it in them bitches' face
Tomorrow morning, I could tell you how them bitches taste

This rap shit is our house, you niggas just visiting
Young Money wolverines, bitch, no Michigan (Ha!)
I get in them hoes' ears and reel them in like fishermen (Leggo!)
And throw they ass in the truck and we rolls like Michelins (Ha)
All—All hail the kings (Kings), crowns glistening
I stunt hard as I fuck 'cause I ain’t getting a chance to live again
Focused is what you better get, boy, we on that better shit (Yes)
All bosses, no executives, you just repetitive (Ha)
You might also like
Now, ain’t you tired of seeing the same shit every day?
I mean, the same shit—Ashley and Mary Kate
Sometimes, I wish that I was blind like Mr. Ray
How come you talking out your ass but ain’t got shit to say?
I spend my money like my time; I ain’t got it to waste
Man, I'm so fast, feel like I'm racing in a different race
Too much champagne, now, watch me spit it in them bitches' face
Tomorrow morning, I could tell you how them bitches taste

Bitch—Bitch, we balling
Tired of the same shit, I need a different toilet
Okay, let me pick my target
Pick them off, now, come pick them up
Big dog, I don't bark, I buck
Tell them bitches I don't talk, I fuck
Tell them niggas I don't walk, I run this shit, I come to punish shit
And I bet they won't be flushing this Young Money shit
We on some other shit, they on the same shit
Bitch, I'm Mack Maine; I'm Mack Maine, bitch!

Now, ain’t you tired of seeing the same shit every day?
I mean, the same shit—Ashley and Mary Kate
Sometimes, I wish that I was blind like Mr. Ray
How come you talking out your ass and ain’t got shit to say?
Young Tune, motherfucker, no anime
Dr. Carter, motherfucker, come to amputate
Cash Money, too much money to calculate
Young Money, that new shit in your face
I spend my money like my time; I ain’t got it to waste
Man, I'm so fast, feel like I'm racing in a different race
Too much champagne, now, watch me spit it in them bitches' face
Tomorrow morning, I could tell you how them bitches taste
Give me the beat and I'ma beat the beat like Anna Mae
What the fuck you thought?
You know I keep the heat like Saint Tropez
C—Cash Money, too much money to calculate
Young Money, that new shit on your face1Embed
