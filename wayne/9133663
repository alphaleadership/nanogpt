Fuck her, send her home, walk in front and might fall

Got bread like Scrooge McDuck
Lil' bitch, I'm happy and I know it so I clap them fuckin' cheeks, yeah
I'm bustin' on yo mama, look like Frosted Mini-Wheats
And I'm happy she's a freak bitch, I been on my tweak shit
I be clappin' cheeks, she got Pixar mom physique
My neck, my back, got your momma on my sack
My checks, my racks, it's the return of the motherfuckin' mack
And I stay with the pack, though
Clap, clap, then I'm out the backdoor
Lil' Pillsbury, I stack dough
Walkin' with a limp like a crack hoe
Yeah, I said, "Oops! Baby"
Fuck up on your bitch, like oopsie daisy
Never knew that was your boo, baby
Hit it five times in the coupe Mercedes, whoopsie daisy, yeah
