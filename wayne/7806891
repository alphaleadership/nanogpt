Kesha, Mr 305, off of my body dale
Theirs some freaks in the living room getting it on
And they ain't leaving til 6 in the mornin'
If you dont know were your from then you dont know
Were your going
But im so lit,I don't know where I'm at or where im going
She take a couple shots
She wanna get my name tatted on
I took her to the tattoo shop
So she could get a tattoo with my name on it ta ta
Time is money, I got Money on my Mind
Life is short, I'm just tryin' buy time
Tik tok , baby life is a race just make sure you make a pit stop, dale (Woo)

Don't stop, makе it pop

Tik Tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

See Kesha LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also like
Ain't got cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: "I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm"
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Imma fight
Til we see the sunlight
Tik Tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Woah-oh oh oh
Woah-oh oh oh

Tonight, Imma fight
Til we see the sunlight
Tik Tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Woah-oh oh oh
Woah-oh oh oh
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Imma fight
Til we see the sunlight

Woah-oh oh oh (yeah, uh,  )

Go by the name of Weezy F and
I'm walkin' out the Bally store with ten bags
Fly as a motherfucker girlie on my staple
Cause her friend say I'm a tummy sucker
Don't go below the navel
I'm up in little Haiti (yeah), I'm blowin' on Jamaica (yeah)
I'm in a pepper Beamer (yeah), I'm with a saltshaker (yeah)
Now I'm in Dade county (yeah), I see some thick bitches (yeah)
I try to holla at 'em but they all trick bitches (damn!)
I think Trina sexy (oh!), mama you wine-fine (yep!)
And on the hush-hush (oh!) we need some quiet time (shh!)
Yeah I'm all right ma , the Birdman's boy 
He own Cash Money, I pre-own Cash Money
Yeah, and I put her on Cash Money
She start wobblin' that ass for me (whoa!)
She start modelin'(whoa!)
She see the models in the Maybach (whoa!)
She call me Weezy F baby and she make sure she say that
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Imma fight
Til we see the sunlight
Tik Tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Woah-oh oh oh
