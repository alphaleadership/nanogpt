Light my body up

I feel like we going under
Take me down
I can't help but wonder
You got everything I want and
If you keep on talking
I'ma put it where you want it
Keep up, ain't no need to slow it down
We could get it poppin'
You could love me, love me downtown
You got everything I want now
Let me fill your fantasies
And give you what you dream 'bout

You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up

Stakes are higher than a mother
What you wanna bet that you'll never find another?
Like me, I'm once in a lifetime
Only get all of me once in your lifetime
I'll leave you drowning in your wet dream
Swimming in that love
Surf it up in your wet dream
Baby, let me blow your cover
Come on, make me wish I was your part time lover

You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down (burnin' me, burning me)
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body upEmbed
