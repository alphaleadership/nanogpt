5 ContributorsHeavy Lyrics
Heavy, in the streets my momma know I'm neck deep
That XD, on my waist I pray this bitch protect me
Envy, I can smell it in the air they hate me
Bitch hate me, all you want, just know I keep it on me
Percy, percocet codeine I'm like a zombie
Brazy, bitches round me ???

Lucky, she gone hold my Glock that's my buddy

Heavy, AK, Mac 11, so heavy, promethy
All up in my bevy them bags look like hefty
I'm ballin professionally look boy you just a referee
Told her call me Hefner, she told me call her Headphanie
I'm so gone I left me I came back to refresh me
Your hoe just request me, she told me you be questionin'
Your hoe want a selfie, she wanna Weezy F me
I got on all these crosses like a Chevy, I'm heavyYou might also like9Embed
