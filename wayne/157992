Young Money (DJ Swift, let's go!)
Young, Young, Young
Young money
Young Mula, baby!

And I can smell her lookin' at I
She recognize real, I don't wear no disguise
And I can see it in her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes (She fuckin' me with her eyes, she fuckin' me with her eyes)
She fuckin' me with her eyes (She fuckin' me with her eyes, yeah!)
She fuckin' me with her eyes (She fuckin' me with her eyes, she fuckin' me with her eyes)
Yeah (She fuckin' me with her eyes, yeah!)

Gazin' out the window of somethin' foreign
Thinking to myself, self
How come gettin' money never gets boring?
How come gettin' money never gets boring?
Baby, I got a stack, now what ya gon' do for it?
Can you bring it back like the motherfuckin' chorus?
Shawty, I've got a stack, now what ya gon' do for it?
Can you bring it back like the motherfuckin' chorus?
Girl, I am hotter than Papa Bears' pourage
Baby, can I put my private parts in your storage?
I can treat your flower like a motherfuckin' florist
Shawty, we can kick it like my name Chuck Norris, hahaha, yeah
You might also like
And I can smell her lookin' at I
She recognize real, I don't wear no disguise
And I can see it in her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes (She fuckin' me with her eyes, she fuckin' me with her eyes)
She fuckin' me with her eyes (She fuckin' me with her eyes, yeah!)
She fuckin' me with her eyes (She fuckin' me with her eyes, she fuckin' me with her eyes)
Yeah (She fuckin' me with her eyes, yeah! Kidd Kidd)

Her Chanel frames are like X-rays (Yeah)
She see us out the club and into the bed (Young)
She picture me in her head and her givin' head (Young)
Handcuffs and whips, I'm a sex slave (Hahaha!)
No wraps on my back, rock with yo' name! (Ugh)
I yell, "Kunta, rah!" Kunta Kinte (Ugh)
With one foot off I still try to escape
But, who can I run to (Who can I?) like Xscape? (Yeah)
I guess I got some attention to pay (Yeah)
The girl blazin' like a doughnut on a early Sunday (Yo!)
And I could be the chocolate on top of her sundae (Woah!)
She lookin' at me like a fat bitch infront of entr√©e, ooh (Woo!)

And I can smell her lookin' at I
She recognize real, I don't wear no disguise
And I can see it in her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes (She fuckin' me with her eyes, she fuckin' me with her eyes)
She fuckin' me with her eyes (She fuckin' me with her eyes, yeah!)
She fuckin' me with her eyes (She fuckin' me with her eyes, she fuckin' me with her eyes)
Yeah, yeah (With her eyes, yeah!)
You see, she wreckless eye-ballin', feelin' a nigga swag
If looks was fuckin', no tellin' how many kids we done had (Hey)
Got me feelin' like Missy (Hey), 'cause she all in my grill (Yo)
Baby, face off the peel (Yo-oh), time to give her that whip appeal (Yo)
Bet ya I can get her home (Yuh), four shots of patron (What?)
And then I know it's on (Yeah), tell my niggas, "Look, I'm gone" (Yeah)
Ma, you're grown, so don't worry (Yeah) 'bout your girls tryna criticize
One night with Mack and, baby girl, you'll be dick-notized
Fatten up your hips and thighs, help that ass 'bout out
Now on the next song you sing, give my dick a shout out
See she could be my sockee (Okay) and I could be her plug (Uh-huh)
Or she could be the fiend and I could be the drugs with no disguise (Hey)

Young, and I can smell her lookin' at I
She recognize real, I don't wear no disguise
And I can see it in her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes (Listen)

All I do is eyes grill him (Kyuh), then he get hard again
He know my pussy stay warmer than a cardigan
Slippery, slimey, excuse me, don't mind me
Say, it's too fat for me to be this tiny (Haha!)
I'm such a maniac (Uh, kyuh), lemme get some brainiac
You know that special head (Uh) like I'm in special ed (Woah)
Got me givin' you these nasty looks
Stick me up with the uhh, that's the nasty jooks
Now, I get him rockier than the cavemen
I deep-deep, I deep throat it 'til it cave in
Uh, you know you like that (Kyuh)
Now put ya-put ya ring on, where ya wife at? (Huh?) The Mistress
Hey, and I can smell her lookin' at I
She recognize real, I don't wear no disguise
And I can see it in her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
Hey

I could see ya lookin' at me
Now what ya wanna do
To me? Hey
She fuckin' me with her eyes
Fuckin' me with her eyes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh2Embed
