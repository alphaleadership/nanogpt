12 ContributorsGHETTO GIRLSᐳᐳᐳᐳ Lyrics
He's heating up
Yeah, yeah

It's somethin' 'bout a project chick, gotta love her
I ain't never too good to fuck a bitch from the hood
You can bring me a bitch out the gutter
You probably wouldn't even talk to them bougie hoes
I don't even like to give out my number
Yeah, but them project bitches wanna love on a nigga
She don't even need nothin' from me, yeah

This bitch just told me that she ain't ever seen Friday
Nigga, you can keep her (What?)
Everybody know I like ghetto bitchеs, that ain't never been no secrеt (Yeah)
Baby like chocolate and yellow bitches, only if everything decent (Okay)
Project bitch set a pretty bitch up, hoes better watch how they speakin'
Yeah, you know the bougie-ass hoes, like to pull girls hair
Project bitches be punchin'
And you better know them other hoes probably gon' run when it's real
But a project bitch ain't runnin' (Mwah)
Told 'em I ain't even tryna pull up to their motherfuckin' party
If a project bitch ain't comin'
I see they got police at the door, tryna pat me down
So my project bitch 'bout to gun it, next
You might also like
It's somethin' 'bout a project chick, gotta love her
I ain't never too good to fuck a bitch from the hood
You can bring me a bitch out the gutter
You probably wouldn't even talk to them bougie hoes
I don't even like to give out my number
Yeah, but them project bitches wanna love on a nigga
She don't even need nothin' from me, yeah

Fuck that shit, it be on FaceBook, fuck that shit these niggas talkin' 'bout
Can I bend you over real quick, in the bathroom at your mama house?
You can tell that I ain't never had shit, but that don't matter, 'cause I got it now
She love to see when daddy got it on, come give me head with your bonnet on
Got a ghetto whip because I came from the ghetto, I'm ghetto like my mama is
I guess I can shake it off, that's just how I'm is
We've been ghetto since we all was kids
And it's only one type of woman that can go to work
And have fun and make time for kids
Better get you a project chick, nigga (Yeah)

It's somethin' 'bout a project chick, gotta love her (Let's go)
I ain't never too good to fuck a bitch from the hood
You can bring me a bitch out the gutter (Yeah)
You probably wouldn't even talk to them bougie hoes
I don't even like to give out my number
Yeah, but them project bitches wanna love on a nigga
She don't even need nothin' from me, yeahEmbed
