1 Contributor​Soul Lyrics
I am now moving on to a different location in the cosmos, but I have left

Hey there you, tryna stand up on your own two feet and, stumbling
Hey there you, tryna stand up on your own two feet and, stumbling
Hey there you, tryna stand up on your own two feet and, stumbling
Hey there you, tryna stand up on your own two feet and, stumbling

Lost soul, lost soul, lost soul
Just ain't feel like myself, no more
Moving up out of my body
And man, I feel like a ghost
Got to find self control, self control
Keep to myself, stay by myself
But I ain't know where to go, where to go, anymore, like no
Nah I'm not like the others
They just some damn suckers
Feel there something to uncover
Soon or later, I'm gon' recover
Revive myself of this suffering
Of this tragedy, that is soon to be
Need release, soon to be free

Free of sanity
Struggling but you just won’t see
Smiling cover and shades what lies beneath
Don’t understand why you want me in the deep
Want me crawling up from underneath
Like I’m on demon time
Climbing out like I done made a crime
Sitting next to you, but I’m just a mime
Tryna get to know you, man like all the time
But you just don’t hear me
So you press decline
Now I’m running out of time
Man I’m running out of time
You might also like
Hey there you, tryna stand up on your own two feet and, stumbling
Hey there you, tryna stand up on your own two feet and, stumbling
Hey there you, tryna stand up on your own two feet and, stumbling
Hey there you, tryna stand up on your own two feet and, stumbling

Swear to god, be somebody
Be something more than what you see in the mirror
Let the world be your mirror
Don't let 'em judge you
Because the mirror can't judge you
You judge what you see in the mirrorEmbed
