6 ContributorsBad Girl Lyrics
If you want it
Come and get it
Yeah

One seven eagle eagle weezy my name, yep
The heater heater fire fire turn on more flame, yep
We the people, all ya people told ya not to speak to
Peeps will leave you sleeping with your people right beneath you
How I like to ignite this track with my butane
How I'd fight like twenty rounds I gotta do Wayne
Weezy F baby baby I keep my shoes clеan
Shirt always matches stay in the new jеans
Yeah I'm young B, what is you saying to me
Really I cannot understand them
If they ain't paying for me
Funny how pig  get there ran from me
But they ain't shit I just go to the other hand, dummy

I've been a bad girl
I must admit this
Welcome to my world in case you missed it
I'm a big deal, it's kinda twisted
But let's just keep it real
I'm the hottest misfit
You might also like
If you want it
Come and get it

I'm a bad girl
Imma do what I do
I can have my cake and eat it too
A girl like me will bring you to your knees
Cause that's what bad girls do
I'm a bad girl
Imma do what I do
I can have my cake and eat it too
A girl like me will bring you to your knees
Cause that's what bad girls do

I'm a bad girl, I'm a, I'm a bad girl
(I like a bad girl, a bad, bad girl)
I'm a bad girl, I'm a, I'm a bad girl
(I like a bad girl, a bad, bad girl)

Come and punish me, you can tie me up boy
Do as you please, make me like a new toy
I´m a MVP, can't nobody touch me
This is my time, you can watch in session
If you want it
Come and get it

I'm a bad girl
Imma do what I do
I can have my cake and eat it too
A girl like me will bring you to your knees
Cause that's what bad girls do
I'm a bad girl
Imma do what I do
I can have my cake and eat it too
A girl like me will bring you to your knees
Cause that's what bad girls do

I'm a bad girl, I'm a, I'm a bad girl
(I like a bad girl, a bad, bad girl)
I'm a bad girl, I'm a, I'm a bad girl
(I like a bad girl, a bad, bad girl)

Bring you to your knees
Bring, bring you to your knees,  knees
Bring, bring, bring you to your knees
Bring you to your knees
Bring, bring you to your knees,  knees
Bring, bring, bring you to your knees
I'm a bad girl
Imma do what I do
I can have my cake and eat it too
A girl like me will bring you to your knees
Cause that's what bad girls do
I'm a bad girl
Imma do what I do
I can have my cake and eat it too
A girl like me will bring you to your knees
Cause that's what bad girls do

I'm a bad girl, I'm a, I'm a bad girl
(I like a bad girl, a bad, bad girl)
I'm a bad girl, I'm a, I'm a bad girl
(I like a bad girl, a bad, bad girl)Embed
