1 ContributorRock N Roll LyricsWe gonna party, all night, let's go, alright, we gonna rock and roll, who wanna rock and roll
Party all night, let's go, alright, we gonna rock and roll, who wanna rock and roll
I'm in this bitch like i wanna rock right now
We so deep you motherfuckers might drown
I'm so fly tonight call me a night owl
I'm high as stars blue skies and white clouds
Talking about let's go crazy, let's go ladies, they all follow soon
...tell it, yeah it's a movie, watch the trailer if it don't float out both, pop the sailor
Party all night, party all night, a whole bunch of bitches this is the dog fight
Begin in the cream, you know off right, a whole lot of smoke, i need fog lights
Young money baby you can't hold me, you can't put me so you can't fold me
Lose your mind, out of control, i now pronounce you rock and roll, yeah
Party, all night, let's go, alright, we gonna rock and roll, who wanna rock and roll
Party all night, let's go, alright, we gonna rock and roll, who wanna rock and rollYou might also likeEmbed
