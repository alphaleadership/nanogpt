1 ContributorCANNON (LIL WAYNE CANNON FREESTYLE) LyricsLike why do I have to get all the lame tracks
Why don't I do track, a dope one
Alright then, do it
Ayt
I just talked to Zeus, and it's on
Been waiting way too long. Okay
Hello World its nasty on the mic
Making sure that you know that I'm a cannon
Look, I got my target locked on
I got my bullets running wild like a mother fucken cannon
I wish I never liked rap, it doesn't make cents
I could do trap music, but I got rands
Even if I didn't, I would still sense
This thing is in my blood, and it's mixed with the blend
Fuck it im incredible, I dont need to rap
You suckers think I need this, I just need a nap
I been working on my arms and I can give a slap
I wanna be a family man and not give a crap
It's just that I like this, I wish they never ruined it
Fuck all the booze, and the chicks and the misfits
Fuck all the As and the Bs and the Cs
And since we are on the Cs, I'm not Nasty C
(now who the fuck would I be)
You might also likeI'm still fly like a phantom in God's eye
You niggas gotta try like a Cannon
My nigga I go hard like a cannon
I still kill bars like a cannon
I'm still fly like a phantom in God's eye
You niggas gotta try like a Cannon
My nigga I go hard like a cannon
I still kill bars like a cannon
Look, I wake up With a cloud on my eye
I been flying all night I didn't see the sunrise
I'm on, this rapping shit better than you ever could
I mean Bars so hard like a ladder should
I mean bars so hard they can fuck a crock
I mean bars so hard they can fuck your lady
I mean bars so hard they can make a baby
I mean bars so hard they even tempt me
Okay okay, I'm in a conversation
Talking to myself with concentration
Listening to myself without the patience
I got the period to myself, ovulation
Yoh, am I the crazy one
God made rappers, now who's this lazy one
And I thought real rap is dead since everybody is doing
Trap music when it's dead
It's not a diss song, I wish it was but not this long
I don't need words in my songs
I could kill the crowd with silence am I wrong
What.. You don't believe me
Okay okay, let's make an eg
Now bring it back
I been wanting to do this for a long time
Since I was a little boy, (now who the fuck would I be)
Since I was a little pikinini (now who the fuck would I be)1Embed
