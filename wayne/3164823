7 ContributorsBitches & Bottles (Let’s Get It Started) (Remix) Lyrics
(Ear Drummers)
Turn up
Ya not hear me?
I said turn up! (Mike Will Made-It)
Woo!
Bitches and bottles
Ya know what is it?
Ay (DJ Khaled)

Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put some ice on your watch and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started

I'm turned up 'til my knob broke
Say turn down, I say nah, ho!
My neck rockin' like Balboa, my watch official it's uncalled for
In the same regions on all floors, I got six sluts on all fo'
They french kiss and say Bonjour
I got my own shine, but I want yours
I'm stupid rich got stupid bitches, you stupid thick, in Louboutin'
Don't like me?
Fuck you again, you wanna fight me?
Well, come do it then
Right hand to God on everything, I see the hearts of men and they bear lame
I won't entertain no punk shit, they talk shit and I run shit
Boy, you tryin' to get what I been here, headed down with like ten here
I'm gettin' it in, 'til it's unreal
Let's say one album like ten mill'
Plus, my swag is stupid low IQ
Heard nigga feelin' all try to
But when you ballin' like I do, you know something, nigga
They don't like you so—
You might also like
Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put some ice on your watch and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started

It's Tunechi, you bitch you
I like sticky weed and sticky pussy
Sittin' on like a 100 mil', I treat that shit like whoopie cushion
Ballin' on them fuck niggas, they on the bench, I bench press em'
They hating, from the sidelines
They pissed off, piss test 'em
Man, I'm on that lean, liquor for the bitches
Who fuckin' wit me? All I hear is crickets
I got stank up in my swisher
My bitch pussy smell like roses
She on that Molly, I'm on that Mary
I'm on that Mary like Joseph
Man, I'm married to this shit
You can call it Shit Carter
Dick stay up like it got insomnia
All them niggas hating, fuck ya in ya pussy
The best things in life are free
Free my nigga Boosie gone
Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put some ice on your watch and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started

OK now lil' nigga, my clique realer
Thick as fuck, I'm a big tipper
In the club 'bout twenty bottles
I make a movie like Ben Stiller
Chase money, don't chase hoes
That peach Ciroc, I'm on straight liquor
Neck froze like Cold Winter
Stand by me in, need a chinchilla
Presidential got plenty rocks
Roc boy like I know Jigga
Riding off in that new shit
I told the dealer you can keep the ceiling
Plenty bitches wanna get the business
I told them it's my dick decision
Goons with me, need supervision
Murk ya dog, if it's slight tension
I hit once and my mind gone
Tipper's short, but my dreads long
See a star, come make a wish
Come take a flick with yo' camera phone
I'm in the club and I'm turnt' to the max
Better be pretty, I'm turning 'em back
Clique full of riders, you know where they at?
R.I.P. Chris, I'mma end it with that
Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put some ice on your watch and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started

Ay, let's order bitches and bottles
Let's order bitches and bottles
They're out of era, our models
They're out of era, our models

Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put some ice on your watch and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started

I make hits, I find hits
And I put hits outEmbed
