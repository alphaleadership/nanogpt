Yeah
2-17 on the track, man

You did it for the broads (Broads)
I did it for the paper (The paper)
Got a hundred styles (Yeah)
Got a hundred acres (Okay)
Fuck the police (Fuck 'em)
Hundred middle fingers (Fuck 'em)
And you a square nigga (Fuck 'em)
You a chess table (Fuck 'em)
You be savin' hoes (Fuck 'em)
You be rest hatin' (Fuck 'em)
Got a lot of rides (Count 'em)
Like a bus station (Pull up)
See my phone ringin' (Hello)
See my diamonds danglin' (Bling)
See the bitches blinkin' (Ooh)
Blue C-notes (Yeah)
All of 'em singing, blue C-notes (Yeah)
All of 'em Franklins, blue C-notes (Yeah)
Spend without thinkin' (Yeah)
A tool without safety (Yeah)
I have your broads taken (Yeah)
I have they heart achin' (Oh)
Push start crankin' (Rrt)
New grill, face it (get 'em)
New mil, taste it (Mmm)
Straight without a chaser (Wasted)
Drawers come from Macy's (Uh-huh)
Broads is confirmation (Yeah)
Same in different places (Yeah)
I run all the bases (Kill 'em)

You did it for the broads (Broads)

I did it for my dogs, I did it for the skaters
I did it for the paper, my niggas still on papers
I got a hundred tats, I got a hundred million
I keep on switchin' wifeys, you gotta Uncle Phil me
Dreadlock Rasta, hair like pasta
I don't see what's your problem, I need an eye doctor
Flying to them dollars, ducking fly swatters
Shoot 'em in the head, leave his mind boggled
Comin' down the boulevard, I'm on your avenue
A half a mil' on my grill, you niggas snaggle tooth, yeah
Told some dead presidents, "I'm finna bury you"
When it come to presidents, I like 'em black and blue, yeah
You did it for the broads (yeah)
I did it for the paper
I got a hundred styles (A hundred)
Got a hundred flavors (Count 'em)
Fuck the police (Fuck 'em)
Hundred middle fingers (Fuck 'em)
And you a square nigga (Fuck 'em)
Blue C-notes (yeah)
All of 'em singin', blue C-notes (Yeah)
All of 'em Franklins, blue C-notes (Yeah)
Spend without thinkin' (Yeah)
Ice on both pinkies (Yeah)
Mobile phone ringin', blue C-notes

Got a hundred styles, got a hundred acres
Got a hundred tats, got a hundred skaters
You did it for the broads, I did it for the paper
I'm 'bout to buy a hog, I'm bringin' home the bacon2Embed
