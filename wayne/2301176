After the show it's the after party then
After the party it's the hotel lobby and
After the Belve' then it's probably Cris'
And after the original it's probably this

L.L. Cool J. is hard as hell
Battle anybody I don't care who you tell
I excel, they all fail
I'm gonna crack shells, Double-L must rock the...

Friends, how many of us have them?
Friends, ones we can depend on

La-Di-Da-Di, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody, we're
Just some men that's on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic right

Fight the power, fight the power
Let me hear ya say
Fight the power
We got to fight the powers that be
You might also like
Straight out of Compton, crazy mother-

Hey, hey, hey, no, no
Jimmy, we've been through this before
You are not straight out of Compton
You are straight out of upstate New York
That's right, yeah yeah
I guess I just thought with the movie being what it is and all
Ya know big, everybody's talking about it
Everybody is talking about it
Let's talk about something else

Let's talk about sex baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about...

Stop, Hammertime
Stop, Summertime

Here it is the groove slightly transform
Just a bit of a break from the norm
(Summer-summer-summertime)
Cash rules everything around me:
CREAM, get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all
[Notorious B.I.G. (feat. Puff Daddy & Mase) – “Mo Money Mo
Problems”]
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

Informer, ya' no say daddy me Snow me I go blame
A licky boom boom down

I lick your boom-boom down
I lick your boom-boom down
No, you don't lick your boom-boom down
I lick your boom-boom down
You don't lick your boom-boom down
Lick boom-boom
No, you don't lick your boom-boom down
Down, down, down, down

I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what
Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone

Now, usually, I don't do this but uh
Go head on and break 'em off wit a lil' preview of the remix
It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum (rum)
I'm like so what I'm drunk (drunk)
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby I'm about to have me some fun
[Chris Brown – Look at Me Now (feat. Lil Wayne & Busta
Rhymes)]
Let's go
Cause I'm feeling like I’m running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
Cause you know I gotta win everyday, day

Damn, damn
Compton

I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

I was running through the six with my
(Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe)
I was running through the six with my woe

(Mustard on the beat, yo)
I don't mess with you
You little stupid ass trick, I ain't messing with you
You little dumb ass trick, I ain't messing with...

Can’t you see the private jets flying over you?
Maybach bumper sticker reads: "What would Hova do?"
J is chillin', Jimmy is chillin'
What more can I say? We killin' 'em

Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say

I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Your mom busted in and said, “What's that noise?"
It's Justin and Jimmy singing Beastie Boys
You got to fight for your right to party
You got to fight for your right to party
Hey, everybody let me hear you say "Parrrrrrty"
