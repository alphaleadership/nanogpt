Yeah, and we smoke that Kush

All I see is signs, all I see is dolla' signs
Oh-ohh-ohh, ohh, oh-oh-oh
All I see is signs, all I see is dolla' signs
Oh-ohh-ohh, ohh, oh-oh-oh
All I see is signs, all I see is dolla' signs
Oh-ohh-ohh, ohh, oh-oh-oh
All I see is signs, all I see is dolla' signs
Oh-ohh-ohh, ohh, oh-oh-oh
Drank, drank, drank, drank
Lean, lean, lean, uh
Oil, oil, oil, oil
Mud, mud, mud, mud
Drink, drink, drink, drink
Lean, lean, lean, uh
Oil, oil, oil, oil
Mud, mud, mud, mud
All I see is signs, all I see is dolla' signs
You might also like
Had my first drank on my birthday
Was a whole pint
Gucci Mane you must be thirsty
'Cause you can sho' drank
Niggas say the Wop broke
Must be an illusion
Gucci got the narc work
Mess with the conclusion
Gucci got the good wood
Wanna walk the damn plank?
Fuck around with Peewee
And damn that boy can sho' drank
Her pussy sweet
Her pussy kiwi
I poured it on her hole
I told her ride me like it's PE
And suck it until she can't
Got her smoking on that good weed
Lean on a Swisher Sweet
I'd rather have a C.N.O.T.E than a Swizz Beat
$50,000 for a C.N.O.T.E beat
He looked out for me
Shout out to my Mexican
'Cause he looked out for me
Drank, drank, drank, drank
Lean, lean, lean, uh
Oil, oil, oil, oil
Mud, mud, mud, mud
Drink, drink, drink, drink
Lean, lean, lean, uh
Oil, oil, oil, oil
Mud, mud, mud, mudEmbed
