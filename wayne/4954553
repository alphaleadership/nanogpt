4 ContributorsFireman (Live) Lyrics
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man (Uh-uh)
He-Man, ski mask, spendin' next week's cash, he fast (Oh)
And I don't even need a G-pass, I'm past that
I'm passin' 'em out now (Yeah), and you can't have that (Yeah)
And my chain, Toucan Sam that
Tropical colors, you can't match that (Oh, no)
Gotta be abstract (Oh, no)
You catch my girl legs open, better smash that (What?)
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at (Boy)
I see she wearin' them jeans that show her buttcrack (Hey)
My girls can't wear that, why? That's where my stash at (Uh-uh-uh)
I put my MAC down (Yeah), that's where you lack at (Yeah)
She need her candle lit (Yeah), and I'ma wax that (Got 'em)
I rekindled the flame (Got 'em), she remember the name (Got 'em)
It's Weezy Baby, January, December, the same (Who?)
Mama, give me that brain (Yeah), mama, give me that good (Yeah)
'Cause I'm the fireman (Oh), you hear the fire truck

I'm the fireman (Yeah), fire, f-fireman (Yeah)
I got that fire, I'm hollering (Yeah)
I got that fire, come and try me, and (Yeah)
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out (I got 'em, get 'em)
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out (I got 'em)

Fresh on campus, it's the Birdman Junior (Yeah)
Money too long, teachers, put away your rulers (Yeah)
Raw Tune, not a cartoon (Ayy)
No shirt, tattoos, and some war wounds (Sexy)
I'm hot, but the car cool
She wet, that's a car-pool
Been in that water since a youngin, you just shark food (Yum, yum)
Quick Draw McGraw, I went to art school (Hah)
Yeah, the lights is bright, but I got a short fuse (Woah)
Don't snooze (No)
Been handlin' the game so long, my thumbs bruised
Your new girlfriend is old news
You ain't got enough green and she so blue, yeah (Aww)
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true (Yes)
Everything is easy, baby, leave it up to Weezy Baby
Put it in the pot, let it steam, let it brew (Yes)
Now, watch me melt, don't burn yourself, 'cause

I'm the fireman (Yeah), fire, f-fireman (Yeah)
I got that fire, I'm hollering (Yeah)
I got that fire, come and try me, and (Yeah)
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out (I got 'em, get 'em)
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out (I got 'em)Embed
