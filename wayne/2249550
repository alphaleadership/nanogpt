10 ContributorsPresident Carter Speaks Lyrics
Whoa, yeah, look here, man, listen, man, listen, man
Good morning, New York
My name is Weezy F Baby, I am the president, and, um
Is this thing on? Testing
Um, today, I come to talk to you about a very serious situation
Uh-uh, yeah, it's this bitch I know, and uh, she don't, she-she, she-she, y-ya know
She's not, she's not your ordinary bitch, ya know? She, she, ya know
You could smell the swagger off of the bitch breath, you know what I mean?
You know, you know, I-I personally don't think, you know, um, um
Any-any you other bitches could fuck with her, you know what I mean?
I mean, don't take that, no, don't take that shit to heart, uh, take it to your pussy
You know what I mean? 'Cause she gon' take it to your necks
And uh, who I'm talkin' 'bout?
I'm talkin' bout Nicki Minaj, nigga, yeah, the Mistress, ha-ha
Yo, they be like, "Why she call herself the Mistress?"
I be like, "I don't know"
And they be like, "I don't know, why she call herself Nicki Lewinsky?"
And I be like, "I don't know"
And they be like, "Why you call yourself the President?"
Eh, fuck y'all
