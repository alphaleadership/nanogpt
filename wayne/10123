8 ContributorsPlayboy (Donâ€™t Hate Me) Lyrics
I be comin' with it
If spot Wayne from a distance in the Expedition
I'm on chrome 20 inches
You'd know who I be
Oh yes you'd know me
4 feet millionaire that's H-O-T
Wodie slow down you might be a hater
Strip ya down to ya draws, hot boy we'll rape ya
Corleone me a mobsta regular
And you can call me on my ce-elier (cellular)
(What) Celebrate and pop the Dom-P (beep)
That's me that drive the Hum-Vee (uh-uh)
Me and Lil Travis
Stuntin' hard lord bless my daddy Rabbit
I got a rolley on my wrist with ten karats
And I'm a shine but I'm still about blastin' (huh)
Nigga lil' shorty bout paper
Bedroom, second floor and elevator
I'm a superstar (star)
Money makin' pimp
Up in the double-R (R)
Just me and Slim
I'm gettin' cheese by the mill's stackin' cake boy
Cash Money how you love that playboy, playboy
You might also like
Don't hate me baby cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me baby cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me baby cause I'm beautiful
How you love that playboy

We go lights, action, camera
We here to hammer ya
Go ask Pamela or your baby mama lil' Tamera
Feel like a samera or Zorro rich niggas don't barrow
Fill a check and wait 'til the bank open tomorrow
Look at your sorrow
Heads gotta meet
Kids gotta eat
Why don't we make a mil'
Rhymin' in and out of beat
In  shit
Shit don't even look for it it's way off
Concerts sellin' out like Chicago Bull's playoffs
So stay off the ground cuz it's dangerous Wodie
Too many riches these bitches gonna wanna hang with us
Wodie
It's a gang of us Wodie
You see one everywhere you go
Ain't no thing with this Wodie
You get it any ear for sure
We go to the bank
So much bitch we got a bedroom
What else count money and give a nigga headroom
So when you hear the leg boom
Bitch you better get somewhere
Somebody gettin' hit somewhere
But on the west start some shit somewhere
Don't hate me baby cause I'm beautiful
These flashy cars ain't new to y'all
Don't hate me baby cause I'm beautiful
These flashy cars ain't new to y'all
Playboy, don't hate me don't hate me don't hate me

I got these niggas talkin' bout this black on black
Hummer
I scored that last summer
But this year playboy I'm a stretch that motherfucker
I bought a Yukon for my main bitch with my new horn
Pictures of other niggas' old ladies suckin' my shit
While you be lovin' this stupid bitch
Now I guess since I been playin' with about 10 mil' or 'sum
These bitches givin' me their pussy like it ain't nothin'
Goin' to the club with 10 G's
And the bar tab that's all on Baby
Lettin' these hoes and niggas drink for free
Playgirl but you gotta understand 1 thing
That shit all on Cash Money
Well here's another case of this ho sprayin' mace in my face
Cause I wouldn't give this ho no play
Tellin' me I think my shit don't stink
Cause I got a Benz, a Hummer, a Lexus
And a penthouse that say "ho hater"
With tattoos with number 1 stunter
With billionaire on my left arm
And millionaire on my right arm
Bitches be lovin' this gold grill homey
I spent 20 G's on my earrings homey
Nigga I ain't met a nigga that can drop a beat like
Fresh
And I ain't met a nigga the can outshine me
See I got a clip that's called "pussy go-getters"
Now playboy these hoes be lovin' these Cash Money
Niggas
Don't hate me baby cause I'm beautiful
These flashy cars ain't new to y'all
Don't hate me baby cause I'm beautiful
These flashy cars ain't new to y'all
Playboy, don't hate me don't hate me don't hate me

What's happenin' this the gator shoe man
Fresh and Vic a new man
Anything come new playboy out I got 2 of that
I think I can love that, I can love that, I can love that
See what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is a- this is a uhmm Cash Money/Big Tymers production
This got Baby, Big Bun see what I'm sayin'
And Lil Wayne, and me myself, The Beautiful one
It's beautiful baby, it's beautiful baby
It's truly beautiful baby
Now what we playin' this year
One Million, two million, maybe three million, maybe four
Y'all just got to you know, hang in there
And see what we gonna do this summer
What we gonna pull off, see what I'm sayin'
What we gonna buy
It's beautiful
I'm just gonna give you a hint you dig
We thinkin' about buyin' a city
I ain't gonna say what city
Just a cityEmbed
