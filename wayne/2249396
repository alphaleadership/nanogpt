4 ContributorsLet It Rock LyricsLet it rock, let it rock, let it rock
I see your dirty face hide behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray a lot to justify the way you live a lie
Live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well, you made your bed, I'm in mine
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar bill
But it broke his heart so he raised his hand and waived it
To the world, to the world, to the world
And you take your time, and you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours, I got mine
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Just let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
I wish I could be as cruel as you
And I wish I could say the things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No, not this timeYou might also likeEmbed
