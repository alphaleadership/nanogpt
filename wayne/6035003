(Rico's going crazy again)
Woo
Iced out Audemars (Audemars)
I got forty thousand
I'm up in all the stores, wait
Hahaha, hahaha
Look
Oh, you feelin' sturdy, nigga?
Look, we 'bout to get sturdy now (Baow)
We 'bout to get sturdy now (Look, shake it)

Iced out Audemars (Audemars)
Got like forty more (Forty more)
Walked in with forty thousand (Forty thou')
I'm up in all the stores (All the stores)
Bad bitch from Baltimore (Baltimore)
And she love Dior (Dior)
She throw a hunnid clip (Clip)
When it rains, it pours (Rains it pours)

Shawty light and sexy (Sexy)
She like givin' becky
Sexy like she drivin' Lexus (Woo)
Bad bitch gon' smack the reverend (Reverеnd)
Spin your block like Tetris (Tetris)
Longhorn, Tеxas
I can't fuck no fat bitch, never (Nah)
I'm young and reckless
I said I'm shootin' proper
I make 'em Cha Cha
I'm a rocker, I'll boom your casa
Then do the Cucaracha
I order steak with lobster
After I smoke my purple
Southside, Nobu, know I'm global
I'm on a different timin'
My VS diamonds dancin'
This ain't no SI stones
I'm smokin' Runtz in Rome
Ice on my neck, I'm freezin'
If you don't suck dick, I'm leavin'
Bad bitch geekin', showin' cleavage
She know she teasin'
Don't try this at home
This for the rich and famous, uh
Highly educated, patient
Off the Runtz, I'm faded
All my cars updated
Only V-12 engines
All my checks is clearin'
Yours is pending
Only drivin' German
In the Benz, I'm swervin'

Iced out Audemars (Audemars, yeah, yeah)
Got like forty more (Forty more, yeah, yeah)
Walked in with forty thousand (Forty thou', yeah, yeah)
I'm up in all the stores (All the stores, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch from Baltimore (Baltimore, uh, what?)
And she love Dior (Dior, yeah, yeah)
She throw a hunnid clip (Clip, yeah, yeah)
When it rains, it pours (Rains it pours, yeah, yeah)

Iced out Audemars (Audemars)
White hair, tartar sauce (Tartar sauce)
Blacked out armored cars (Yeah)
Rest in peace to Pop
We here today, we gone tomorrow (Gone tomorrow)
That's the art of war (Art of war)
Too many fallen stars (Fallen stars)
And when it rains it storms (Yeah)
Iced out Audemars, uh (Mula)
Get rich or die gettin' rich
Wu-Tang been and the cream been cream
And the cash ruled everything around me since, yeah
Cream, get the money, whole team get the money
Hoes dream they could fuck me, codeine got me muddy
Machine gun knock his whole spleen out his stomach
I get on one knee and let it ring like I love 'em
And the scene got ugly
But it's beautiful, baby, it's marvelous, pretty
Some flowers and daisies, you obviously brazy
You get shot up from the knot in your head to the knot in your laces
Then skrr, skrr, three or four phones on chirp chirp
I forgot the young nerd, she hit me with the three percs
Head so dumb, make a numb nigga knee jerk
Roll so hard, nigga grind 'til his teeth hurt
Count my, count my, count my snakes
Count my cake and momma I'm baked
Count my blessings everytime that I pray (Ooh)
Body count raise, every shot that I take (Ooh)
Cotton candy iced out Audemars Piguet
Audemars Piguet but I ain't got time of day
Got a body on my wrist (Ooh), got diamonds in the face (Ooh)
Audemars, iced out, iced out, iced out
Iced out Audemars (Audemars)
Got like forty more (Forty more)
Walked in with forty thousand (Forty thousand)
I'm up in all the stores (All the stores)
Bad bitch from Baltimore (Baltimore, yeah, yeah)
And she love Dior (Dior, yeah, yeah)
She throw a hunnid clip (Clip, yeah, yeah)
When it rains, it pours (Rains it pours, yeah, yeah)

Iced out Audemars (Audemars)
White hair, tartar sauce (Tartar sauce)
Iced out all the dawgs (All the dawgs)
Rest in peace to Pop
We here today, we gone tomorrow (Gone tomorrow)
That's the art of war (Art of war)
Too many fallen stars (Fallen stars)
New York, New Orleans boys
Iced out Audemars
