1 ContributorA Milli (Freestyle) Lyrics
Bangladesh
Haha, yall already know man
Africa's best
Yo  what's good man
I'm in the studio right now
I'm just gonna mess around with this for a minute, 'ight?
Wonda World baby
Yall already know L.I.B
My whole team
Yo, scream at me, wonderworld

In my past life, I heard of all death before dishonor
But I dishonor death if my life is being honored
'Cause sometimes in life, yo
Talk is not  and actions speak louder, yo
Thank god I'm fortunate
Knew I had some  so I  it
I got so much  on me I'm tryna auction it
Too many rappers  sound pathetic
You a hater then  cause I'm allergic to critics
If you lookin' for the best then of course it's 
 fly  swag yo I called it swagitific
With thеse propane , spent no 
Don't еven test lil' man, this is hurricane, yo
 really hate me 'cause they know I'm  provokin'
Spittin' knowledge and the facts is the only blunt I'm smokin'
I'm prepared to go extra miles with this lyrical fight
I'ma keep screaming out 'til Africa unite, hallar, yea
My party people yall already know yall boy killin' it
I'ma take another turn at this one

Whack rappers are like 
Got the game 
That's the reason  said "Hip-Hop is dead."
This ain't even my beat, its quick 
I call shots when I speak
I practice what I preach
Haters say I won't shine, they forgot I'ma star
I have stripes before I'm  came to a 
Money is not  respect everything
 not for, except 
Yo, regardless where I'm from, I'm a shark in the ocean
The ones better than me just got killed to abortion
The 
Yall smoke trees, son
I smoke the 
 two for nine  get it for 
And  is sick too, I ain't get it for dabs, uh
I mess with models not the R Kelly 
My sex game, call it  rendervo

Yo all the fly honnies in the building, y'all I'm just messin' with y'all already know
That's how it's goin' down
My homie for life, yo, Wonda World
Yo what up 
The whole squad man
Yo lil' , yea, I knew you was comin' through son
Later, peace (Uh, uh)Embed
