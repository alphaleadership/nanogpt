Enrique, Usher
This is for the dirty girls
All around the world
Here we go!
Dirty, dirty dancer

Another day, another night
And she acting like she don’t sleep
She’s a five when she drinks
But she’s a ten when she’s on top of me
Listen!

She don’t wanna love, she just wanna touch
She’s a greedy girl to never get enough
She don’t wanna love, she just wanna touch
She’s got all the moves to make you get it up

She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only
See Enrique Iglesias LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like
It’s a game (ha) that she plays
She can win with her eyes closed
It’s insane how she tames
She can turn you to an animal
Yeah, yeahhh

She don’t wanna love, she just wanna touch
She’s a greedy girl to never get enough
She don’t wanna love, she just wanna touch
She’s got all the moves to make you give it up

She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only
(Never be her only)

Hello baby, it’s Weezy Baby
It’s going down, depreciating
Okay now I don’t dance, unless we dancing dirty
Skinny leather pants, I’m on my Eddie Murphy
Shawty shake it fast like she in a hurry
I like the full glass, and I like my Mary Bloody
If she ain’t doing you, then you ain’t doing nothing
And ain’t no money, like Young Money
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only
C'mon!

She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only, never be her only
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only6Embed
