32 ContributorsEther Freestyle Lyrics
Haters nigga, Sqad Up nigga
Fuck JAY-Z, nah my nigga, I fucks wit' JAY-Z, sorry, you know what I'm sayin'?
Fuck JAY-Z, no no no, I fucks wit' the homie man, sorry no
Fuck JAY-Z
Yes we bout to Sqad this thing out, baby
Is y'all ready to squad wit' me, then throw yo guns in the air muhfucka
If you ain't got a gun get the fuck up outta here muhfucka
'Cause we gon' bust it in ya head muhfucka
We here muhfucka, yeah, this is the squad right here
Dawg and no the rhyme didn't even start yet, bitch
But here we go, come on Wayne, look

I, young money boy Lil' Weezy hold it for A and Eagle
Cash Money cross the belly, Cash Money Makaveli
We get that fetti fellas, we bump that Roc-a-fella
We got it pumpin' holla back we crack rocafellas
Nigga my tires better, I'm on them monsta bellas
I got that brown boy or that white Consuela
Fee this shit over, I got us that's a promise
Let's go cop two new Rovers, drop it on Magic Johnsons
That's 32's for fools stick to them stuntin' rules
500 up in ya tummy, can you stomach dude
S Q my young'n crew we paid our fuckin' dues
That's why yo bitch is over here suckin' and fuckin' dudes
Y'all niggas want a war bring it it's nothing dude
This shit too hot to relax bitch don't get comfortable
I fuck with super Sammy Blanco and fuck the bull
Hydro I puff and pull until I'm duckin' full
What are you fuckin crazy come on its Weezy baby
No for real bitch its Weezy baby
Call me bad Wayne and I'm like Max Payne
The sickest shit to hit since anthrax came
I leave you with a Tampax frame all bloody
Just stand back man y'all don't want it
But damn that man I come thru and do my Grand Theft thang
My cran-ap tan cap slant back thang
My hustle game up plus my flow that ugly
Just call me Mitchell and Ness I got throwback money
I got that um all good if its no crack money
I got that, he's all good, he don't need to show that money
I blow that money cause I know that money
Hit the club and wild out and go and throw that money
If that bitch on 21's then you know that's money
I'm a pimp I'm bout to perm it out and bullrush somethin'
You a snitch you probably hit the court and burn dude
Thats that Weezy the shit that make your soul burn slow, fuck ya
You might also like
Fuck ya
S-Q-A-D Holla at ya boy
They can't fuck wit' me man
I don't, dawg, I don't see 'em fuckin wit ya nigga right here, ya know what I'm sayin
Call me the throwback young'n, bitch every time you see me I'm in the 70's hoe
You don't know if it's a jersey or the pimp game bitch
Or it might just be the shit I got in my back pocket, you know what I'm sayin'?
In the balloon or the silver pack, what you how you want it nigga? Huh? How you want it dawg?
It's whatever we got it nigga from 64's to Bentleys, to Porsches nigga to the, to the, to the fuckin G-Wag
You don't see a G-Wag in the city unless it Weezy, and that white lady but we don't know her, you know what I'm sayin'?
That's how we doin' it dawg
This ya boy right here Man I'm holdin' it down for the N.O
And when you come past here you entering my home nigga
I, I run New Orleans east I'm a 17 nigga but I run the East Man
You know what I'm sayin', so, so when you get to sheps think of Weezy man
Know you steppin' into Weezy territory, you more than welcome to come holla at me man
I got whatever you need, holla at ya people man
Squad up I see y'all baby its all love dawg, hm2Embed
