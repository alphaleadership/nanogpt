6 ContributorsB4 U Go Lyrics
Before you go just let me kiss it one more time
I make you stop right at that door and press rewind
I’m probably somewhere up in Paris smelling wine
Let’s have a ball cause I ball like debutante
And if it’s a crime they’ll lock us up we’ll do our time
Girl we must be flies cause I’m on your shit and you’re on mine
But don’t even trip cause I’m on your hip and a gun on mine
And the day I slip will be the day the sun don’t shine

Baby hold up a second
Before you leave
Mama put that purse down
Come back to me
I know your runnin late
But baby Imma make it worth your while
If you stay here
Baby take them shoes off
Unbutton that blouse
Take that pen out your hair
Let your hair hang out
Unzip get that skirt
Come sip on her
I know you gotta go but baby
You might also like
But babe before you go
Lay you down put me on the floor
So I can make up this scene
But babe before you go
Go crazy like u puttin on a show
So I can make up this dream
See it came to me last night
While I was dreamin I thought it was real
But that’s all right
Cause I got that real thing girl
Babe before you go
Go head and give it to me like you never have before
And I’ll do the same too
Before you go...

You know I like it in the morning
But this ain't my fault
I saw you gettin dressed and
Lookin all soft
Baby I can't help it
I saw it all in a dream
Sexy as you wanna be and I
Yea I gotta give it up to ya
You was doin your thang
You was movin that body
In ways I never seen
When I woke up next to ya
I was lookin for the real thing
Baby lay back down with me
But babe before you go
Lay you down put me on the floor
So I can make up this scene
But babe before you go
Go crazy like u puttin on a show
So I can make up this dream
See it came to me last night
While I was dreamin I thought it was real
But that’s all right
Cause I got that real thing girl
Babe before you go
Go head and give it to me like you never have before
And I’ll do the same too
Before you go...

Oh oh ok it’s Weezy baby
And she appreciates me
I make her stay with me
And she leave him waitin
And before I go she tell me I’m the best
Then she kiss me on my chest
Then I tell her I’m impressed
I confess, we obsessed
Then we do it on the desk
Then we let the house keeper come and clean up the mess
Yes, it’s never no
Then we do it on the floor
Then we do it some more (some more)
Before you go
Girl I know you gotta go
But you really turn me on
Girl I know you think I’m wrong but hey
I see the smile on your face
You was thinking the same thing
We ain't got no time to waste baby
I promise Imma make it good
Ima love you like I should
So I really wish you would come back to me
Mama get back into bed with me
So we can do this before you go

But babe before you go
Lay you down put me on the floor
So I can make up this scene
But babe before you go
Go crazy like u puttin on a show
So I can make up this dream
See it came to me last night
While I was dreamin I thought it was real
But that’s all right
Cause I got that real thing girl
Babe before you go
Go head and give it to me like you never have before
And I’ll do the same too
Before you go...Embed
