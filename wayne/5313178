Turn that shit up
Turn me up too
Yeah, mic check
Yeah, this is the mic check, I can't hear, alright
Alright, oh yeah

Smoking on the good kush, sipping on the codeine
Spitting all this fire, living off the proceeds
Tipping on 44, pimping all your hoes
We gon' do  it bigger than she ever did with your ass
Sleeping on Polo, I don't got no doors
Can't forget she in love with the coco
Hustling on the low-low, duffle bag, YOLO
And I'ma laugh to the bank on you bitches, no joke, yeah

You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad
You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad, no
You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad
Don't make me get my gang
Don't make me get my squad
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Squad, squad, squad, squad, squad
Squad, squad up
Get your fucking ass tied up
Need some hitters for the job, call us, job done, yeah

Fake nigga lie to a real nigga
That's just some shit that you don't do
I used to wake up to the sun too
Now I wake up everyday to a lawsuit
Now my pills kicking in like kung-fu
Dipped the blunt in the syrup like fondue
I shoot up everybody in a carpool
I'm the shit with these bars, call it barstool
I'll knock a nigga ass to the north pole
I'll beat a triggerman in a heartbeat
I'll leave his heart beating at his own feet
Take his car keys, ride around til it's on E
My homies all know that it's on me
And if it's on me we gon' eat like we never ate
Have a second plate, nigga gotta eat everyday
Feeding heavyweights
Nigga trying to see better days, lord knows
Ain't no such thing as second place
No such thing as yesterday, ain't no such thing as tomorrow
And promises is for hoes, and diamonds is all gold
If you fucking with my squad though, it be clean up, aisle 4
That's just how it go, niggas slipping like Dial soap
Either I'm too high or the clouds low
And I go Michael Myers, psycho lion, hyperwire, mic on fire
Bad bitch, tight attire, treat me like I'm siar, like a giant
Play below the belt and I'm Orion
My oh my, my flights is higher, price is higher
Life inspired by the riots, I'm a rider, can't deny it
Can't describe it, can't disguise it, advertise it
I'm smoking on the good kush, sipping on the codeine
Spitting all this fire, living off the proceeds
My bitch got that good juice
My plug got them low fees
I'm laughing to the bank though
'Cause these lil niggas joking

You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad
You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad, no
You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad
Don't make me get my gang
Don't make me get my squad
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Squad, squad, squad, squad, squad
Squad, squad up
Get your fucking ass tied up
Need a nigga head bust, hire us, job done
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Squad, squad, squad, squad, squad, squad, squad up
Tied up, job done, woah
Smoking on the good kush, sipping on the codeine
Spitting all this fire, living off the proceeds
Tipping on 44, pimping all your hoes
We gon' do  it bigger than she ever did with your ass
Sleeping on Polo, I don't got no doors
Can't forget she in love with the coco
Hustling on the low-low, duffle bag, YOLO
And I'ma laugh to the fucking bank, bitch no joke

You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad
You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad, no
You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad
Don't make me get my gang
Don't make me get my squad
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
