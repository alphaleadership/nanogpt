6 ContributorsMy House Lyrics
All you girls
I mean, my girl

And you can come spend the night at my house, girl
You can drink all you want at my house, girl
You can smoke all you want at my house, girl
That's my house, girl
That's my house, girl
And we can fuck all we want in my house, girl
Its all cool, the neighbors done moved out, girl
And you can scream all you want at my house, girl
That's my house, girl
That's my house, girl

Hold On Baby You Know What It Is
Young Money Fly Boy You Know Where I Live
New Orleans, At A Red Light Puffin' on light green
Lookin For A Birdy To Put Under My Wing
Hot damnit, I Got One So Now Shorty Ridin Shotgun
Get Her To The Crib I Could Tell She Was Shocked
That Im Livin This Good And My Album Hasnt Dropped Yet
Im Like Shorty Be Cool Make Yourself Comfortable
Turn On The Tube reruns of The Huxtables
Then We Gon' Move Off To The Bedroom
Get You In The nude I'm Tryna See If You head Strong
You might also like
And you can come spend the night at my house, girl
You can drink all you want at my house, girl
You can smoke all you want at my house, girl
That's my house, girl
That's my house, girl
And we can fuck all we want in my house, girl
Its all cool, the neighbors done moved out, girl
And you can scream all you want at my house, girl
That's my house, girl
That's my house, girl

Same Thing Just A Different Day
Jaguar XK Rippin Up The Interstate
Cell Phone Ringin Every Minute Its A Different Name
Judges Tryin To Give Me Life Cuz I Got That Killa Game
Momma Wanna Hang Around Me Cuz Her Man Is A Jerk
Only Time She Feel Freak Is When Homie Go To Work
She Just Wanna Come Over Watch Me And Maine Play Video Games
While She Chillin On The Sofa
Readin On The Magazine Sippin' On Champagne
Long As You Respect The Crib You Can Do Anything
Get Loud When We Cuttin Ain't Nobody Gonna Hear
Im The Man Of The House, I Pay The Bills Over Here
Yeah, she walk through the front door
Then, we get it on the floor, get—get it on the floor
Yeah, she walk through the front door
Then, we get it on the floor, then we get—get it on the floor
Get—get it on the floor
I said, we get it on the floor, Mami, get that ass back to me
Give that ass a smack, now say my name back to me
We get it on the floor, Mami, get that ass back to me
Give that ass a smack, now say my name back to me
(Weezy!)

And you can come spend the night at my house, girl
You can drink all you want at my house, girl
You can smoke all you want at my house, girl
That's my house, girl
That's my house, girl
And we can fuck all we want in my house, girl
Its all cool, the neighbors done moved out, girl
And you can scream all you want at my house, girl
That's my house, girl
That's my house, girlEmbed
