1 ContributorAnything You Want Lyrics
Wah, wah, wah wah
Unplugged, Lil Weezy
Wah wah, wah wah
Wah wah, wah wah, wah

I'll buy your clothes and anything that you want from me
Ain't nothing but a fan of me, ain't nothing but some chance of me
And I'll ice you out and anything that you want from me
Ain't nothing but a fan of me, ain't nothing but some chance of me

What you need, what you need, baby tell me
First, let me tell you what you've gotta do
Girl, it ain't sweet, so don't you try to play me
'Cause I can make you hate me
If you give me your love, I can give you anything, yeah

I'll buy your clothes and anything that you want from me
Ain't nothing but a fan of me, ain't nothing but some chance of me
And I'll ice you out and anything that you want from me
Ain't nothing but a fan of me, ain't nothing but some chance of me

Dolce and Gabbana, Fendi, Ferragamo
Let me know, it's just for show
Platinum ice and Prada, anything you wanna
Cool with me if you're my shawty
You might also like
I'll buy your clothes and anything that you want from me
Ain't nothing but a fan of me, ain't nothing but some chance of me
And I'll ice you out and anything that you want from me
Ain't nothing but a fan of me, ain't nothing but some chance of me

Aye, you know one thing, Wayne got cheddar
Get you a platinum piece, ice every letter
Gucci shoes, Prada dress, mink sweater
For the summer, hot red Hummer, pink leather
Dolce, Gabanna, Chanel, whatever
Me and you up in a two-seat compressor
Drop the top on the 2G Porche Carrera
Let your hair down, watch it fly like feathers
Hot Boy ya know, Big Tymer ya heard
I cut on Tha Block Is Hot, you better sing every word
I like my women topless, Bentley topless
Twenties spotless, mm-hmm, stop it
Me and Unplugged, we some thugs, can't change us
Better get it right, I'll send ya back to where ya came from
Give me all the ice, all the clothes, all the stacks
Drop it at the door 'cause I need all like that

I'll buy your clothes and anything that you want from me
Ain't nothing but a fan of me, ain't nothing but some chance of me
And I'll ice you out and anything that you want from me
Ain't nothing but a fan of me, ain't nothing but some chance of me
I'll buy your clothes and anything that you want from me
Ain't nothing but a fan of me, ain't nothing but some chance of me
And I'll ice you out and anything that you want from me
Ain't nothing but a fan of me, ain't nothing but some chance of meEmbed
