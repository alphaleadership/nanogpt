I know these girls names...
Hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, yeaah hold up (?)

Let me tell you about maria, she let me high, Aalyah
Thank God I ain't blind, I fuck her every time I see her
Smoke a blunt and fuck Aalyah, i don't know, i miss my coke
And get a beer from Sophia, You probably in that area
I know a bitch named Dominique, She live here by the beach
Her pussy get wet when you kiss her on the cheek
Used to fuck her every week, but now We don't speak
Cause I fuck her best friend, Angelina, she got a face
Like a Appleonia, her body like a lollipop
She rode me like a Horse
