5 ContributorsDowntown Lyrics
Pocket full of molly
Pocket full of my shit
Let’s try this shit
Try this shit
I might buy this shit

I said, ain’t no party like a downtown party ‘cause a downtown party don’t -
Yeah
Ain’t no party like a uptown party ‘cause a uptown party don’t -
Yeah
I got a pocket full of molly
I’m about to catch a body
I walk around with my towel on in the lobby
I’m a downtown nigga, just left Follies
I just left Magic, I just left Vonnies
I’m a downtown nigga, I might go to Walter’s, buy a pair of FILAs and wear ‘em to the alter
I’m a downtown nigga, I’m headed to the Park
Martin Luther King, Cascade Boulevard
I’m a downtown nigga, I’m on B Street, last night chicken waffles, lean in my sweet tea, aye
I’m a downtown nigga, Ruth Chris, Benihana's, Then I left Serana’s, saw the Hawks play the Thunder
I’m a downtown nigga, I say, “Shawty I’m straight!”
Downtown nigga from the mothafuckin’ A, aye

Ain’t no party likе a downtown party ‘cause a downtown party don’t -
Yeah
I said, ain’t no party like a uptown party ‘causе a uptown party don’t -

Uh, I’m from uptown, we ‘bout to touchdown
I’m double cuppin’, boy don’t make me put my cup down
I got some hittas with me, they got some hittas with ‘em
And my bitch is so pretty, that all the bitches feel ‘em
And they can shake like a dog, hop like a frog
Ride it like a horse, scream and holler 'til they lose they voice
I got a pocket full of xannies
I’m ‘bout to catch a tannie ‘cause I live out in Miami
I give dick out like candy
And I just left LIV, I just left Tootsies
And I just left King of Diamonds with more diamonds than my jewelry
I’m a uptown nigga, I just left the second line
2 people got shot, that shit happen every time
A uptown nigga, I just left the projects
They tore ‘em down, made ‘em an apartment complex
I’m a uptown nigga, I’m on Eagle Street, you get assassinated ridin’ down Martin Luther King
I got the whole city of New Orleans on lean, I’m a uptown nigga, Hollygrove, 17
I’m a uptown nigga, I say, “Bitch, I’m me”
Uptown nigga, that UPT, yeah

Ain’t no party like a downtown party ‘cause a downtown party don’t -
Yeah
I say, ain’t no party like a uptown party ‘cause a uptown party don’t -
Yeah
Ain’t no party like a downtown party ‘cause a downtown party don’t -
Yeah
Ain’t no party like a uptown party ‘cause a uptown party don’t -
Yeah
Mannie Fresh on the beat

We got Fresh on the beat
Now where downtown at?

Yeah, where downtown at?
Where downtown at?
Where uptown at?
Where uptown at?
I’m from downtown, I’m ‘bout to tear it down
I’m from uptown, we ‘bout to touchdown
I’m from downtown, we ‘bout to tear it down
I’m from uptown, we ‘bout to touchdown

Yeah, ain’t no nigga like a uptown nigga, ‘cause a downtown nigga ain’t - shit
I say, ain’t no nigga like a downtown nigga, ‘cause a uptown nigga ain’t - shit
Well, I’m a uptown nigga with my dick in my hand
Got a gun in my pocket, a extra clip in my pants
Yeah, I’m a uptown nigga with the world in my hands
Got a gun in my pocket, I got your girl in my pants, yeah
1 plus 1, what do you get? You get a uptown nigga runnin’ in yo’ shit
I say, 10 plus 7, what do you get? You get a 17 nigga runnin’ in yo’ shit
YeahEmbed
