2 ContributorsAlways Strapped Lyrics
Aww
Aww, aww
CMB, we in the buildin'
Yeah
Swagged out, one hunnid

Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back

Yessir
Check me out, look

26 inches, bitch, I'm sittin' crooked
Old school Chevy faster than a silver bullet
Strawberry paint, seats, vanilla puddin'
Two bitches, goin' in eat each others' pussy
Top chopped sent the car to the barbershop
My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot
I'm so unorthodox
I got your bitch ridin' my dick with no shocks
Ha, bounce bitch, bounce, bounce, ha
I'm the hottest shit jumpin' out the coffee pot
Man, I'm just tryna to get my spot like a polka dot
Lil' kush make my eyes and my shoulders drop
Lil' syrup and I can make a soda pop
Keep talkin' 'n' I can make my soldiers pop
Real niggas with me ridin' 'til the motor stop
I got these hoes straight livin' out a soap op'
I got it covered like a coke top, okay?
You might also like
Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs and since I'm paid
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm
Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back

Yeah, shawty, the last MOB
Fly in the Bugatti with a tool on the seat
Put the K in the car while we ridin' blades
Put that chopper on the pussy in the driveway
Bet the house on the youngin' then we got paid
Triple colors on the bikes and a new Mercedes
Bustin' keys on the ave how we got paid
From I-10's ridin' high to a open bay
Uptown made man out the hallway
Crab in the bucket fifty shots, bitch, make a way
I thought they knew, shawty, like father like son
Ball 'til you fall, stuntin' with them paper plates
Throwin' hundreds on them hoes while we eat steaks
We in the club poppin' bottles like everyday
We grind for the shine, nigga, gettin' big money
Got a fleet tossin' chicken, nigga, get cake
I'm on his island with this power like Scarface
I'm in the Impala droptop, chunky
Ice man Birdman rockin' Red Monkeys
Already, nigga, neighborhood superstar
And we gon' ball til we fall, bitch
Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs and since I'm paid
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm
Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em backEmbed
