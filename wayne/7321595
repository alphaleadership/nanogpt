2 ContributorsHow To Love Lyrics
Cut the music up
A little louder, yeah

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to care, 'cause you could be anybody
Like you never had a love, never had a love

When you was just a youngin, your thoughts werе so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blеssing
But you can’t have a boy talk to you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this dark corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to care, 'cause you could be anybody
Like you never had a love, had a love
You might also like
See, I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love, yeah
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to loveEmbed
