1 ContributorEverybody Know Me Lyrics
Attention all club goers, and party seekers
Oooh yeah, it’s Mika Means
Mika, let's go
 + (Lil Wayne)
In the ATL everybody floss (Yeah)
Everytime I go out everything costs (Uh-huh)
Only money talks on Monday to Sunday (Yeah)
Never only one day, then party like a payday (Let go)
Excuse me while I make my way to the front
On line of the club, I just jumped out the truck
If I’m in the velvet room you can find me on stage (Come on)
With a CD in my hand talking to the DJ
If I ever lose my cool, gotta take it up top (Yeah)
Where it's cold and it's gritty
What’s up New York City
Where they don’t give a fuck (Yeah)
'Bout your story or your luck (Oh)
Everybody gotta hustle when you're living up north

I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me
Everybody know me
Everybody know me
Everybody know me
Everybody know me
Everybody know me
I love big things
I like big bling
Everybody know me
Everybody know me
Everybody know me
Everybody know me
Everybody know me

When I wanna get away (I'm MIA)
Club Sobe they know me (Who's up Jose)
Transport me to long beach (Hey bay bay)
If I really want a party (Hello LA)
Hey dro all day (Hey paparazzi)
In the middle of the West Side (I throw it this way)
But when I really wanna party (It’s St. Tropez)
If you thinking what I’m thinking everybody say (Ayeee)
Everybody say (Ohhh)
Everybody bring the party from the VIP to the floor
Spend a little more
If you ain’t making it then fake it then
No matter what the cost is
Show ’em who the boss is
Say

I make big money, I drive big cars

And since I really ball, they be trying to throw me
King size bed, bad bitch below me
Drop out the sky like ‘hi’
It’s my turn to burn like soap in my eye
So that means ain’t nobody fresher than I
Pockets got me looking like an extra big guy
Cause I make big money, I made Young Money
