And I rise up
And I rise up
And I rise up
And I rise up
I rise up
I rise up

Yeah, yeah, yeah, and so I rise
The news on TV, I roll my eyes
The good and the bad, it's do or die
Like a snake with two heads saying "Blow out mines"
Lord knows I'm trying, I just hope I'm fine
If I live to see tomorrow, Lord you're too kind
And I know in due time it'll be the end of time
So if I buy some time that's some expensive time
Until my time is up I'm in the sky's above
My eyes may be closed but I'm alive enough
My eyes may be red, I seen a lot of bloods
Started from the bottom, now it's bottoms up
Got a couple questions, no response to one
That's live for who? And that's die for what?
I know I'm the guy that only God can judge
I'ma rise up til I rise above, yeah
