1 ContributorHot Boy (Remix) Lyrics
That boy Cassius
Oh

Come through lookin' like the old me
White T-shirt and Girbaud jeans
Smokin' OG, I'm a OG
Sippin' Codeine, I'm a whole fiend
Been a Hot Boy since 14
Gotta get my money up by all means
Used to sell rock by the Walgreens
I was 14, having orgies
Stunt real hard, real-real-real hard
On a broke ass nigga, then steal his broad
She ask me what the tear drops on my face
I told that bitch, "These tears of joy"
I got a big ass house, got cameras everywhere
Big ass closet, I don't know what I'ma wear
Even if I changе, the game don't change
A pimp gon' bе pimp and a ho gon' be herself
Squad, these niggas might get rowdy
Cocaine cowboy nigga like howdy
Codeine drought, tell them boys I got it
Nitpicky bitch, do the Josephine Johnny
Hot Boy Tunechi, all the hot girls love me
My clique brazy, everybody clutchin'
Everybody cuffin', everybody muddy
Stunna not around, but everybody stuntin'
You might also like
Bitch, I'm ballin' like a Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Juvie
That's still my big brother, always told me I was the best in music
Yeah, I'm ballin' like a Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, nigga, Lil Weezy
I'm still the best rapper, I ain't hungry, nigga, I'm greedy, yeah
Ballin' like a Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, free B. Gizzle
That's still my big brother, been gettin' locked up since we was little, damn
Ballin' like a Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, nigga, Young Turk
That been my bro since day one, like January the first, Lord

Come through looking like a dope dealer (Get it)
I ain't stuntin' none of ya'll broke niggas (None of y'all)
At the trap spot where we post, nigga (Get it)
I'm a get a mansion and a boat, nigga (Get it)
Ferragamo frames and a coat, nigga (Fresh)
Fuck girlfriend, she's a gold digger
One thing I don't need is no nigga
Bought a AMG Benz cause it go quicker (Skrr)
Fresh in the VIP, lit up (Lit up)
Fuck nigga try and get hit up (Woo!)
All it take is one call, nigga (Call, nigga)
I have a nigga set at ya'll niggas (Hello?)
Instagram timeline full of ya'll bitches
Ya'll niggas unofficial trying to act official (What?)
You a pussy ass nigga, and I know it, nigga (I know it)
You a pussy ass nigga, and you show it, nigga
Ballin' real hard, real, real, real hard
They don't even like the fact, know I'm playing with the set
Had the motherfucker offset white
Then I had to paint the motherfucker black, how you love that?
Ballin' like a motherfucking Hot Boy, like we in '98
Nigga, how it look? Juvie
Young nigga ballin', I made a movie
All these hoes in the jacuzzi (Hey)
Ballin' like a Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Juvie
Stickin' to the G-Code, 400, Beast Mode, y'all niggas know how we do it
Ballin' like a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, nigga, Lil Weezy
Feelin' like Birdman and Meechy, block out, lights out, nigga, we eatin'
Ballin' like a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, nigga, B. Gizzle
Chopper in the city, I'm the motherfucking made man, ya'll pussy niggas in the middle
Ballin' like a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, nigga, Young Turk (Turk, Turk, Turk, Turk)
Young nigga, thuggin' is first, young nigga puttin' in work (I'm Mr. YNT!)

If you know Turk, know I’m a thug, nigga (Thug nigga)
Don’t talk, I'ma just let the slug hit him (Slug hit him)
Ridin' with a trunk full of go-get-'em
Chopper with a scope, I ain’t gon' miss
Fresh out the feds on the same shit (Same shit)
Words on the streets I’m dangerous (I’m dangerous)
That fuck nigga at home, can’t shit (Can't shit)
Now I’m going for the nigga that he hang with (That he hang with)
Walking pockets on bankroll (Bankroll)
Tryna tell me be cool, but I stay froze
I don't fuck with these niggas, I'm so low (I don't fuck with 'em)
If you waitin' on a nigga, you’ll stay broke (You'll stay broke)
Got a hot girl doing what I say so (Hot, hot)
Big ass booty, think it’s fake, though (Fake, though)
Make a lot of money, tryna make more (Tryna make more)
Just trying to get in like a gate code
YNT the mob, so we'll get in the job done
Pussy nigga tell them don’t try me (YNT!)
After I hit 'em, throw the burner in the river
If they find it, I know they gon' hide me (I know they gon' hide me)
Nine years in the pen, can’t go back in
But I still scream "Free BG!" (Free BG)
Look at the money and I see it's still growin'
So who the fuck wanna fuck with me? Hot Boy, nigga
Ballin' like a Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Juvie
Stickin' to the G-Code, 400, Beast Mode, y'all niggas know how we do it
Ballin' like a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, nigga, Lil Weezy
Feelin' like Birdman and Meechy, block out, lights out, nigga, we eatin' (What you did?)
Ballin' like a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, nigga, B. Gizzle
Chopper in the city, I'm the motherfucking made man, ya'll pussy niggas in the middle
Ballin' like a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, a Hot Boy, nigga, Young Turk
Young nigga, thuggin' is first, young nigga puttin' in work

Everything I got, it come from street money
It's 14 nigga fucking with '03 money
Old nigga still 'bout it, don't sleep on him
Ride for it on you niggas, I don't see nothin'
It’s a new Jag sittin' on OG money
I run for it and run for it and I’ma keep runnin'
I’m a fighter, gotta keep me like 300
If you learnin' G code, you can eat from it
Good work and low price, that’s a quick flip
Might take about five, maybe six trips
I keep my hand on the money all day
And when I don’t, I have it on a thick bitch hips
Got an ordinary nine with a big clip
No time for the small, just the big shit
I can’t smoke 'cause I’m on probation
It be a couple more months 'fore the shit lifts
I'm fly like the Good Year blimp
Can't lie, it's been a good year, pimp
Ya'll monkey ass niggas like chimps
You wanna see a Hot Boy, I'm him
Ballin' like a Hot Boy, I'm a Hot Boy, I'm 400 (Yeah)
Ballin' like a Hot Boy, I'm a Hot Boy, bling bling, more money, more stuntin' (Yeah)

Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Tunechi
5 Hunnid degrees, nigga, 5 hunnid degrees
Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, Hot Boy, nigga, Lil Weezy
From Hot Boy to Fireman, I think I hear someone screaming, hold up
Yeah
I pull up
Mula, baby
A-yeah
Hold up, hold upEmbed
