1 ContributorCPR (Butterfly)  Lyrics
Uh, getcho ass back in this house girl
We ain’t gotta let all of the neighbors up in our world, cool it
It’s cool ‘cause you sexy when you mad though
And if we weather the storm, I bet that rain make the grass grow
And I heard the grass is greener on the other side
We gotta give love a chance to change into a butterfly
Talking to myself like, “Wayne you can’t fuck up another time”
Give it CPR, watch the relationship come alive

B-B-B-Before you go, can we, talk a moment
We shouldn't end it like this, yeah
C-C-Can you just chill for a while
Put your bags down, and just try to hear me out, yeah
And I-I know that recently, we've been, fussing and fighting, yeah
And I-I know you're tired of me
But i-if you leave, this is how I'll be

Look
Picture me broken hearted
Now the love is dead, you can smell the rigor mortisYou might also likeEmbed
