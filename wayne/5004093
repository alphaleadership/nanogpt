37 ContributorsThoughts Lyrics
Here (Ah)
She's fine too, but I want you (Ah)
Slowly, driftin' slowly
Yeah, if you could see the thoughts that's in my head

Slowly, driftin' slowly (Slow)
Got my eyes spinnin' so slowly like the two hands in my Rollie
It's my time, come put that on me (Come put that on me)
You'll still be my one and only, or my lonely, or my doley
What's outside, and just don't OD on them girls that came before you
I won't OD on them guys that came before me, oh, I
Movin' lowkey (Movin' lowkey on—)
Beat that pussy like you owe me
Girl, you know me, and that's all me, oh, I
We both did thangs before, feelings and things involved
But I'm not to blame at all

These just ain't words (Words) that I'm spittin' (Yeah)
If you could see the thoughts (Ooh)
Thoughts that's in my, thoughts that's in my head (In my head)
These just ain't words (These ain't words), I feel a spark (Oh)
It's either that or I'm just caught up in my head (Ooh, in my head)
I can't help it (Can't help it)
All the ways you did your thing, that made me selfish (Oh, I)
These just ain't words, I'm addicted (Yeah)
If you could see what it's my head, I need you in my bed, oh
You might also like
On my mind
Yeah, you been in my head, and I just don't know why
But since you left my bed, girl, my sun don't shine
I just haven't been myself, no, this ain't good for my health
So tell me, can you help it?
Baby, let's remind each other love is for us if we don't rewind
Let's keep movin' forward, leave the past behind
It don't matter who's before me, I know that you adore me

These just ain't words (Word) that I'm spittin' (Yeah)
If you could see the thoughts (Ooh)
Thoughts that's in my, thoughts that's in my head (In my head)
These just ain't words (These ain't words), I feel a spark (Oh)
It's either that or I'm just caught up in my head (Ooh, in my head)
I can't help it (Can't help it)
All the ways you did your thing, that made me selfish (Oh, I)
These just ain't words (Yeah)
I'm addicted (Yeah, I'm addicted)
If you could see what it's my head, I need you in my bed, oh

Yeah
And if I see you with that other nigga (Mmm)
I might spaz if I see you with that other bitch (Mmm)
I might dance if you see me with that other bitch (Damn)
You might harass, we can't be friends, I'm too far in (Yeah)
Open my mind (Yeah) and you walked in
I cannot be for real
When I went and copped the Richard
It was therapeutic, had to free my mind (Mind)
When I cut off all my bitches
It was only you I couldn't leave behind (Yeah)
Polly want a cracker, she said, "Please don't call me Polly"
She want me to call her bad words, these just ain't words
And you know I love you like good food
You know you're fuckin' with a good dude
You know you givin' me good brain
Like you graduated from a good school
These just ain't words (These just ain't words, words)
That I'm spittin' (That I'm spittin', yeah)
If you could see the thoughts (Ooh)
Thoughts that's in my, thoughts that's in my head (In my head)
These just ain't words (These just ain't words)
I feel a spark (Feel a spark, ooh)
It's either that or I'm just caught up in my head (Ooh, in my head)
I can't help it (Yeah)
All the ways you did your thing, that made me selfish (Yeah, oh, I)
These just ain't words (These just ain't words)
I'm addicted (I'm addicted, yeah)
If you could see what it's my head, I need you in my bed, oh

These just ain't words
Thoughts that's in my, thoughts that's in my head
These just ain't words
Caught up in my head
I can't help it
All the ways you did your thing, that made me selfish
These just ain't words, I'm addicted
If you could see what's in my head, I need you in my bed, oh10Embed
