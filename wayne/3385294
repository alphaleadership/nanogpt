5 ContributorsLove Of My Life Lyrics
Weezy Baby, T-Streets
Sqadfizzle in yo back
Fee-fizzle where we at
Love of my life listen...

I met her when i was a young bo'
Took her home, rolled her up and got my puff on
And then my lungs withdrawn
And then after follow my heart
This is only the start
Went out and bought my baby at tha start of my day
Sometimes i wanna know if he was here
What my father would say
Keep smokin', T-Streets what you smokin' on?
Cuz me, i'm rollin' up that green pokemon
And you be super loaded of the dro i'm on
And you see i can't see wit my eyes open, dawg
Weezy Wee fo' yall
Pleez let tha drama hold off
Light it up, '03 smoke DAWG

Girl you know you rock my world and
You be pur-ple green and o-range
We won't stop un-til tha roach is
Gone, yeaaa, gone, yeaaaa, gone, yeaaaaa, ha-ha
You might also like
I picked her up when i was just a kid
Really, i fucked her before all of my friends
Really, i blows off tha dro and heineken silly
Im T-Strizzy, Streets is the name they give me
Baby girl get lifted with your boy
Top lifted off tha car
Hot shit in my cigar mama
It don't stink, it's not fit for my cigar potna
I mosh pit in my cigar potna
Green grass got me feelin' clean as glass, i'm bright
That bitch Mary Jane that's the love of my life

Yeah, i second that man, i second that i say
That bitch Mary Jane, that's the love of my life

Man, ya'll knoe how i met her
I cop her from tha homie in letters
Oz's nigga i got chedder
I don't smoke trees, i smoke the tree
No bullshit, you gotta bitch, bet she smoke wit me
And if she did bet she choke
If she did bet i put something soothin' down her throat
But that's on another note so
Ha-ha, let me get back to my hoe
Let me twist a sack of my hoe
That is my doe, we gits irry
You gon' find me in your lobby blunted
Maybach outside and it's probably runnin'
I'm a boss, droppin' ashes on my bentley rug
Before i fix it, i just have them reinvent the mug
Way bent off the dro
Way bent off the shit
Laid back and play pimp on a bitch
Relax and play this to a spliff
Where's my lite, Mary Jane that's the love of my life
T-Streets man, I second that
Mary Jane, that's the love of my life

Girl you know you rock my world and
You be pur-ple green and o-range
We won't stop un-til tha roach is
Gone, yeaaa, gone, yeaaaa, gone, yeaaaaa, ha-ha
