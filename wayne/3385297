3 ContributorsThis Is The Way We Sqad Lyrics
I'm Weezy Baby, back on the scene, underground king
Pimp C and Bun, you my fathers I'm your son
Group on 21s, barkin' up the ride
But really I ain't trippin' I jus' like ta be high
Nigga we SQAD, we real, we pure
Baby blue Ferrari of the Nellyville tour
And we could all eat til our belly get full
If not we show our teeth and Mack 11's get pull
But that's another story, lets get back ta this thang
Righ na me and Fi negotiating buy the Saints
We might buy the Rams, we might buy the Hornets
It's scary boy young money cause all them bitches garbage
Your beef it better squash it caise right na we jus' marching
If ya ain't in the band on expand it cost a margin
My hands is often frosty cause the band on the corner fifty grand on my fortress

This is the way we SQAD
And we like ta floss
Weezy is the boss
I represent that dirty dirty dirty dirty Souf
And we ridin' chops
The ones that never stop
The Young Money boys and we SQAD this shit out
You might also like
It's Gudda Gudda
Streets representor
Big Benz whipper
I like Lion Hearts but I rather ride spinners
I'm smokin' on that killa, I'm higha than a bitch
We signed ta Cash Money, Young Money got rich
Now you see we ball, now you see the SQAD
We pullin' up in 10 different color bubble cars
I'm on a world tour and don't gotta album
It don't make sense but i make a lotta cabbage
I'm tryna get rich
I'm tryna get paid
I rip the damn show and get head backstage
I'm livin' in the range, like I'm in a cage
I pull that thang out and send a couple ta yo brains
I don't like the cops man mothafuckin' Feds
I represent Sqad Up til I'm muthafuckin' dead
A muthafuckin' red stand taller than a muhafuckin' hater Gutta Gutta
What the fuck up!

This is the way we SQAD
And we like ta floss
Weezy is the boss
I represent that dirty dirty dirty dirty Souf
And we ridin' chops
The ones that never stop
The Young Money boys and we SQAD this shit out
I'm thinkin' 22's fa my bitch new Benz
I'm thinkin' 2 new Benzes fa my bitch two friends
I'm thinkin' no top in any kinda weather
I'm thinkin' smokin purple and blueberry togetha'
I'm feelin' all hawain punch is up fa' serve
I'm feelin' fuck what 'cha say and fuck what 'cha heard
I'm feelin' Sqad Up tha shit, I know ya smell it
And tell me we gon' do numbers like Nelly
Fa' sure!

And I know Young Money bout ta fuck up the game
And I know ya like that shit Gudda spitt'n with Wayne
And I know I rock platinum, fuck the silvery chain
And I know niggas dissin' but I don't know they names
And I make bitches scream when I step out the coupe
And I make the kids ask me where the fuck is your roof
And I make the rawest shit when I step out the booth
I'm livin' Gudda muthafucka, how bout you?

This is the way we SQAD
And we like ta floss
Weezy is the boss
I represent that dirty dirty dirty dirty Souf
And we ridin' chops
The ones that never stop
The Young Money boys and we SQAD this shit outEmbed
