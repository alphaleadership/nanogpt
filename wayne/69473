Workin' all winter
Shinin' all summer
I ain't no beginner
You scared to take it to the—

Take it to the head, yeah-yeah
Don't think about it, be about it
Don't be scared to take it to the head, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Girl, you fly but if I tell you, then you might take it to the head (Yeah)
I'm in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I'm gone (Ooh-ooh)
Take it to the head (Yeah)
I'm in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed (Ooh-ooh)
One shot, two shots, I'm gone
Now we gon' get fucked up, no excuses, no apologies
(Maybach Music)

Reputation for G's, that's the role of a boss
So amazin' to see, black baguettes in my watch
She say love is for free, just expensive to shop
But it's nothin' to me (Uh), that extends from my block (Ugh!)
I got a lot of figures (Yeah), I'm a father figure (Me)
She know a lot of niggas, don't know a hotter nigga (Ha!)
Come to the winner's circle, a lot of men will hurt you
But I'm here to nurture (For real), I wanna take you further
She got all them purses, I say in my verses
YSL and Hermès and barely scratch the surface (Ugh!)
She know her purpose (Ugh!), as I peel the curtains
I always make her nervous (Ugh!), this record's perfect (Woo-hoo, ooh)

Yo, reputation for bustin', pussy open, it's nothin'
Big fat nigga, all that huffin' and puffin'
Take me shoppin' in France and he pay in advance
He got big balls, ran a play in his pants
Ran away with his money just to chill on the Island
All my bitches is stylin', beaches, and eatin' Italian
This is real shit, r-r-real shit
On the real, nigga fuckin' with a real bitch
I-I-I ride for him, DMV
Stamina, GNC
Three letters, CMB

Uh, reputation for tastin'
I'm killin' them hoes like Jason
Girl, that pussy like medication to patients
Got my eyes closed like Asian persuasion
Fuck with me baby, it's Tunechi, baby
Bust a nut, smoke a blunt, now I'm rejuvenated
With all that pink on, bitch, I'm King Kong
I eat her ice cream, she eat my ice cream cone (Hahaha)
Pop a pill and pop that pussy
I bet you Tunechi make her throw away that silver bullet, yeah
And she kiss me on my neck and she kiss me on my chest (Woo-hoo, ooh)
And then she—
Take it to the head (Haha), yeah-yeah (Drink it down, yeah)
