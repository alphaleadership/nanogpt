5 ContributorsAfter Disaster Lyrics
Yeah
Uhh Uhh Uhh Uhh
Yeah
I Can't Feel My Face, yeah
I mean it sound so beautiful, you dig?
Yeah, I know
'Elz, talk to 'em

When the levees broke, when the planes hit
What's going on my nigga? You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We hold our heads high, after disaster
When the levees broke, when the planes hit
What's going on my nigga? The same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We hold our heads high, after disaster

They couldn't kill me, holla if you feel me
Hurricane Katrina victim in the building
Okay, daytime soldier, nighttime rider (rider)
9/11 survivor, holla (Yeah, I feel you)
And who am I to try to keep hope alive
When I'm seeing dead babies floating by
Damn, burning buildings, flamed up (up)
They couldn't take the heat so they jumped (jumped)
Man, they want to want to transform the streets we grew up on
A deck of cards with no aces: luck gone
Uhh, tower 1 fell (fell), tower 2 fell (fell)
Now everybody screwed like loose nails
I'm like what are we to do with a house with no roof
Look up and pray to whose above You
God, now just look in your seat
Black people, white people, all covered in debris
Yeah
You might also like
When the levees broke, when the planes hit
What's going on my nigga? You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We hold our heads high, after disaster
When the levees broke, when the planes hit
What's going on my nigga? The same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We hold our heads high, after disaster

Yeah, we try to keep our head up, and not get fed up (nope)
But it seems like they won't let us, live
And I was told that life ain't shit and this world ain't neither
That's why I scream fuck the world not the people (nope)
Yes, but in the Belly of the Beast
People get swallowed like meat, eat
And your president was lying while my people was dying
In the helicopter flying, looking down reading signs
(Help!) SOS, somebody save us!
Ten dead inside, where our savior?
And, I've seen tragedy I've looked it in the eye
Hate being at my lowest so I choose to get high (high)
So high, that my name should be sky
It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's I
Yea, I holla 504 till they bury me man
I'm the father of New Orleans and I'm a family man
You heard me
When the levees broke, when the planes hit
What's going on my nigga? You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We hold our heads high, after disaster
When the levees broke, when the planes hit
What's going on my nigga? The same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We hold our heads high, after disaster

Now, if I should die before my time, Lord
Take care of Ju Ju and his mom (please)
Take care of little Jah (please), take care all the kids (please)
Cause through us they live
Yeah, Lord please keep Your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul You keep
And I don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
I can't take much more, I just want to be free (free)
They said they knew there was a problem with the levees, and they did nothing (nothing)
Clinton approved the money, Bush did nothing (nothing)
So, Katrina hit (hit), and three days later, Fema just coming
Ain't this something?
I'm feeling like what the hell is really going on
Planes into buildings, what's next, King Kong?
I wish we didn't even have a reason for this song (but we do)
Moment of silence for the people that's gone (Shhhhh)
To those resting in peace
Those dead and deceased, soon again we meet (soon)
Or 'til I'm high and drunk and my car swerves off road (Ha)
I'll meet you at the crossroads (yep)
Lord please keep Your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul You keep
And I don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
I can't take much more, I just want to be free
When the levees broke, when the planes hit
What's going on my nigga? You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We hold our heads high, after disaster
When the levees broke, when the planes hit
What's going on my nigga? The same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We hold our heads high, after disasterEmbed
