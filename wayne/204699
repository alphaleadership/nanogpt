8 ContributorsBye Bye (Konvict Remix) Lyrics
This is for my people who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high (Put 'em way up high)
We will never say bye, no, no, no (Never say goodbye)
Mama's, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins (Yeah)
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers (Yeah)
Lift your head to the sky (Lift 'em way up high)
'Cause we will never say bye (Never say goodbye)

I know, I know you’re gone, I know I'll see you again
One thing that I can promise, we gon' meet up again
Hopefully up in Heaven, prayin' that I'm forgiven
For everything that I've done, and that I forgot to mention
I feel so bad to be without my homie
And ever since you've been absent, I've been so lonely
Why does life cycle around like a trophy?
Even though I know somebody took the time to warn me
That you can't be with me and it's just crazy
And every day I'm wishing that you could come save me
And I know a man ain't supposed to cry
It’s taken all the strength in my soul to say goodbye

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye (Say goodbye)
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye (Say goodbye)
You might also like
And you never got a chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever

I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by (As time goes by)
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye
Yeah, I feel you, sweetheart, let me talk to 'em
Yeah, how come they call it goodbye?
How come the good die?
See, I just get high and think of the good times
That I had with my pops, he was a good guy
How come the good die?? As I protect my mother
'Cause I'm her oldest son, and there are different worlds
And we in the coldest one, which one did granny go to?
And why do death come?
As my baby ask, "where do babies come from?"
I tell her, "where?", I tell her "why?"
And I tell her I love her until I tell her bye
And whenever I shall ever die, I hope you celebrate it
I hope you never hate it, and they say Heaven's gated
But I think I know the code, and let's get your life right
By the end of the road, that’s why I drive alone down memory lane
So if I crash, I hope you all remember Wayne, goodbye

Never knew I could hurt like this (I never knew it)
And everyday life rolls on (Every day of life, I wish)
I wish I could talk to you for awhile (I wish)
Miss you, but I try not to cry (I wish)
As time goes by (I'm wishin' as time goes by)
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you (And be right here next to you)
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye

Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (It's hard to say bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (So come on, somebody sing it with me)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (Wave your hands up high)
Bye bye (Hey)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (So this is for my peoples who just lost somebody)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (So this is for everybody)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (Just keep your hands to the sky)
Bye bye, bye bye ('Cause we will never say bye bye)Embed
