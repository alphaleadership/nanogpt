10 ContributorsSucka Free Lyrics
Good life good tree
Be you sucka free
What a time
Woo hoo
Living that life
No fake
Oh oh oh oh
Pour it up for the realest ay
Pour it up for the realest yuh
Toot it up for the realest ay
Woo hoo

On my mind
Never fold I'ma win it every time
I ain't perfect but I almost touch that line (yah)
Said she into that shit that I like (ay)
Pour out that clear need a vibe outa sight
Henny than it ain't right
If it ain't the Henny than it ain't right
I, yeah I spy all those trolls on my line
Catfishin' ass bitches y'all ain't fine
Oh, that ain't you no
Saw you out wasn't sure if it was you yuh
Get it, wasted
Takin' them pics
It ain't me
You might also like
Good life good tree
Be you sucka free
What a time
Woo hoo
Livin' that life
No fake
Oh oh oh oh
Pour it up for the realest ay
Drink it up if you the realest yuh
Fuck it up if you the realest
Bop bop bop bop bop

Mulah
Good time give me good time
Got these lookin' ass niggas tryna look blind
Give me good girls that don't fuck with good guys
I fuck yo bitch from 9 to 5 and tell her good job
He a bystander baby he just stood by
She a skinny bitch but in her pics she look fine
Tell that bitch to say my name she say good god
Bring yo bible next time get yo book signed
Jozzy are you riding
Where the hoes at in the lobby
In my Maybach got you riding shottie
Under my seat is a shottie
Good times
Good life good tree
Be you sucka free
What a time
Woo hoo
Livin' that life
No fake
Oh oh oh oh
Pour it up for the realest ay
Pour it up for the realest yuh
Toot it up for the realest
Fuck it up, fuck it up

People lie
If someone tryna bring you drama don't reply
Face to face they can't look you in the eye
And if you see a sucka out just say hi (hey girl)
These fast ass stretch marks they wanna bite
Henny it ain't right
Yeah I need the Henny in my life
I, yeah I spite all those faces on my line
Catfishin' ass bitches y'all ain't fine
Woo hoo
Woo hoo
Woo hoo
Woo hoo
Better life
Take a drink gotta say what's on my mind
Don't hate when I say this
Good life good tree
Be you sucka free
For the night
Woo hoo
Good times
No fake
Pour it up for the realest3Embed
