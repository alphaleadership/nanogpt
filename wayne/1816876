7 ContributorsSouthside (Remix) Lyrics
Suwoo
Bitch, I'm from the South: Southside
We all ride
And when we catch a outsider outside (Brrrat): y'all die
We all ride (You know?)
And when you see us, we be leaning to the side: (Yeah) the Southside
We all ride (Just like that, pimpin')
And when we catch a outsider outside: y'all die
We all ride
(Junior) Ay, pussy nigga, you know you ain't from the South

Catch me in the whip, extra with the clip
Leaning to the right side, army guns, big chips
Wine candy on the strip
You know how we get it when we comin' with the flip
'Cause we runnin' with the flip
And the money is a must and hoes we don't trust
Guns in the cut, bitch know what's up
Twenty on the slab, fifty in the Jag'
Comin' through the air, hustlin' on her ass
Ordinary nigga with extraordinary style
Swagger to the ceiling, nigga, hustlin' gon' wild
Hustlin' with my child, blowin' out the pound
Come from uptown, banana clips: a hundred rounds
You might also like
Bitch, I'm from the South: Southside
We all ride
And when we catch a outsider outside: y'all die
We all ride
And when you see us, we be leaning to the side: the Southside
We all ride
And when we (Yeah) catch a outsider (Young Money) outside (What up, J Rich? What up, Lo?): y'all die
(Bitch, I'm Mack Maine) We all ride
Ay (Uh huh), pussy nigga (Yeah), you know you ain't from the South

Ay, rest in peace to Pimp C, homie, we still sippin'
Our shoe strings ain't tied, homie, we still trippin'
It's Young Money, Cash Money, y'all better start prayin'
Bunch of redshirt freshman, boy, we is not playin'
I'm sayin' your whip is just a freak to get your Phantom flip
Potassium for beef heads: you get banana clips
Homie, I sit back, laugh while you chit-chat
And make a twenty ounce out a bitch nigga six pack
Fake niggas had to take it outside (Take it outside)
We real 'round here, you ain't gon' make it outside (Make it outside)
Found naked outside (Side), jaw breaked outside (Side)
Wit' yo' body in a rot
Nigga, it's the Southside (Nigga, it's the Southside)
Bitch, I'm from the South: Southside (Southside)
We all ride (Triple C)
And when we catch a outsider outside (CMB): y'all die (Birdman)
We all ride (Lil Weezy)
And when you see us, we be (What up, blood?) leaning to the side (Southside): the Southside (Southside)
We all ride
And when we catch a outsider outside (Young Money): y'all die
(New money) We all ride
Ay, pussy (Yeahhh) nigga, you know you ain't from the South

I may wake up with a bitch, like, "Am I really dreamin'?"
First round draft pick, dammit, Willie Beamon
Hammer in the Bimmer, not a Plaxico Burress
Boy better want Floyd, he can't handle my flurry
Golden glove with the hooks, ho and hearts on a Benz
Blow a dub on the books, now that's what you call a friend
What I call a min, you can call a thousand grams
Yeah, we still call it girl but this is a man's world
When she see me, she can smell it: broke nigga repellant
Type "Southside" in your navigation, can you spell it?
When she see me, she can smell it: broke nigga repellant
Type "Southside" in your navigation, can you spell it?

Bitch, I'm from the South (You know): Southside (Just like)
We all (Candy paint, nigga) ride
And when we catch a outsider (We don't play wit' these pussies) outside: (Big money shit) y'all die
We all ride (Global wit' it, you know?)
And when you see us, we be (Yeah, baby) leaning to the side (Born rich): the Southside
(Neighborhood superstar) We all ride
And when we catch a (Junior) outsider (Young Mula) outside: y'all die (CMB)
We all ride (Yeah, baby)
Ay, pussy nigga, you know you (Army guns, nigga) ain't from the SouthEmbed
