8 ContributorsGYALIS (Remix) Lyrics
Oh, it's the remix, oh
I see her
She came with her nigga (Oh)
Mm, but she gon' slide right to my side, I know (Right to my side)
She pulled up with her friends (She pulled up with her friends, yeah)
Then we skrrt off in the Benz (Skrrt off in the Benz), oh
Took her back to my crib and I regret it
'Cause she tryna, oh (Ayy)

Fake like she asleep, uh
Swear she tried to stay the whole week
I'm like, "Oh, nah, she gotta go," uh
Ask me her namе, I swear I don't even fuckin' know
Thеy wanna know why di gyal dem deh 'pon me
Dem eye green, dem mind just set pon me
They wanna know why dem love him off so much
Like what is the reason, oh-oh

Mm, it's just the vibe, I'm that guy (Girl, it's just the vibe)
She put her legs in the sky whenever I
Pull up, she got her clothes off from the walk-in
She won't waste no time, oh
She don't want nobody else, I know
But I can't be what she wants (I can't be what she wants)
They all have the same story
They all want me to themselves
But I'm a—
You might also like
She don't wanna go tonight
She don't wanna be alone
She would rather me turn off my phone
Don't take me eye off her
Take her out the clothes that I bought her
She want me to live up to the hype
But she don't wanna share me, I
I wanna tell her, I got her, yeah
And this will be no problem, yeah
Let her lay and honestly
Tell your girl to keep an eye on me, now tell her
This is my palace
I don't wanna have to explain to her man where his gyal is

Oh, it's just the vibe, I'm that guy (Weh)
She put her legs in the sky whenever I (Woii yoii)
Pull up, she got her clothes off when we walk in
She won't waste no time, oh
She don't want nobody else, I know
But I can't be what she wants
They all have the same story (Weh)
They all want me to themselves
But I'ma—

Can't let her roll, spliffs be tight, by though

Whenever I pull up, it's a light show
Gang with me, we ain't even gotta try
Every eye deh 'pon we when we arrive
That pussy wet like a faucet (Pussy wet like a faucet)
I know her body, oh, I know
