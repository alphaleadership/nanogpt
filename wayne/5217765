12 ContributorsShoot Up The Casket Lyrics
Ayy (Ayy)
Pull up on your block, old school Chevy four doors (Aye)
I hit for a brick, went and spent it on Melrose (Woo)
I was tryna kill ya, no brainer, scarecrow (Hey)

Bitch, I got the Devil in me
High speed, yeah, I got Berettas with me
Oh, and a nigga ain't safe in the ground, we gon' dig 'em up
Graveyard, bitch, I got a shovel with me (I keep a shovel with me)

You ain't gotta do no askin'
I'm tryna shoot up the casket (Hey, I'm tryna, tryna)
I'm tryna shoot up the casket (Hey, blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt)
I'm tryna shoot up the casket (Thu-thu-thu-thu, thu-thu-thu)
I'm tryna shoot up the casket (Thu-thu-thu)

Hit 'em in the stomach, give him the hiccups (Huh)
If I had a Bazooka, I'd blow this whole shit up (Yeah)
I'm tryna take the gold off his casket
Wipe his nose (Slatt, wipe his nose)
Ain't no tellin' what I wanna do
Man, only God knows (Woo, hey)
Shoot to the max when I pull up on you (On you)
Mad Max, I'm on one-thirty-two (One-thirty-two)
Cinemax, watch me move when I move (When I move)
I think God picked your card, man
I think he want you (Gotta go home)
Anybody with 'em get whacked (Yeah)
Every time you see me, got a Gat' (Got the Gat')
And my bitch, she a brat (She a brat)
All these hoes did that (She did)
Why the fuck these niggas did that?
Tampax Pearl, nigga, bleedin' through the jacket (Blatt, blatt)
Run up on 'em, take his racks (Blatt, blatt)
Blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt

Bitch, I got the Devil in me
High speed, yeah, I got Berettas with me
Oh, and a nigga ain't safe in the ground, we gon' dig 'em up
Graveyard, bitch, I got a shovel with me (I keep a shovel with me)

You ain't gotta do no askin'
I'm tryna shoot up the casket (Hey, I'm tryna, tryna)
I'm tryna shoot up the casket (Hey, blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt)
I'm tryna shoot up the casket (Thu-thu-thu-thu, thu-thu-thu)
I'm tryna shoot up the casket (Thu-thu-thu)

Ayy (Ayy)
Pull up on your block, old school Chevy four doors (Ayy)
I hit for a brick, went and spent it on Melrose (Woo)
I was tryna kill ya, no brainer, scarecrow (Hey)

No fairytales, just stories
I like listenin' to No Worries
On the phone with Satan and Jesus
Seein' which one is gonna ignore me
Click, I don't wait, I get cozy, nada safe
Stay up night I’m tired of day
Kids at park and not to play
All black shades on not for shade
He just flinched and shot away, that-a-way
Put a shell up to you ear and you can hear what shots'll say
Holiday, back when kids would Harlem Shake
I was straight which one of y'all took my smile away
Out of place, don't got much they gotta take
Tuck that chain, hide that watch, put your fuckin' style away
Diggity shot 'em then he flew out to Dior to hibernate
Courtroom straight face, name don’t ring bells
She love me or nah? I'm high, can't tell
I still need closure, Funeral can't help
There’s still some things, gotta prove to myself
Bitch, I got the Devil in me
High speed, yeah, I got Berettas with me
Oh, and a nigga ain't safe in the ground, we gon' dig 'em up
Graveyard, bitch, I got a shovel with me (I keep a shovel with me)

You ain't gotta do no askin'
I'm tryna shoot up the casket (Hey, I'm tryna, tryna)
I'm tryna shoot up the casket (Hey, blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt)
I'm tryna shoot up the casket (Thu-thu-thu-thu, thu-thu-thu)
I'm tryna shoot up the casket (Thu-thu-thu)

Bricks on the beat
Uh, put a nigga 6 underneath
Shoot up the casket I hope his clique and his daddy front row seat
From his head to his feet
Bullet holes from his teeth to his sneaks
YME excuse my French it's all about oui oui oui
Don’t want no smoke with me
That water ocean deep
Ballin’ I got more upholsteries than groceries
We pay them boys no mind, they get no overage fee
Bah Bah Bah Bah Bah Bah sound sweeter than some poetry
I got the devil in me!
You know yo’ bitch wanna take a selfie with me
I’m smokin’ lace I got some bass I got some treble with me
I know your place I know your pace I got your schedule with me
Ooh that nigga ain’t safe in the ground
That nigga ain’t safe in the clouds
His niggas ain’t safe in the crowd
My trigger finger 200 pounds
That silencer on the tommy gun that nigga ain’t makin’ a sound
We shoot up the whole place and after that go smoke some loud
