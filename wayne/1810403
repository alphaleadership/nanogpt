2 ContributorsGround Zero (Original Version) Lyrics
Back the hell off!
Rock and roll Jesus with all my nails on
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond
And give these blind motherfuckers somethin' to feel on
Rollin' like a motherfucker, put your wheels on
And let's roll down the hill 'til the hill gone
I started on the block but that's somethin, to build on
And how can I pray when I got nuttin' to kneel on?

Hey! The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down 'cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone

Son, look up
Father just shook us
Never was around like Bush is
War just came like Kane with bishop
Movies too different to act not used ta
Boys in the hood messed up
No blueprints they just do it
Then they get commercial shootin'
Ruthless, live your T.I. or lose it
Stupid people like ya'll once knew 'em
Who da, new nigga is show and prove it
Never skateboard but I grinds in these Supras
Ya'll niggas foolin', for fame and the fortune
Super human, 430 flame horses
Ready to use it, L.A. to Jerusalem
Betty Bootin, my girls fake Hollywood tits
Couldn't fool 'em, I just pull up
And I hold her, yeah, and adjust, to the mood (Tshh...)

Let's let's let's jump off a building baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby
Jump jump out a window
Let's let's let's jump off a building baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby

Hey! The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down 'cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone

Hey, I know a girl named Crystal, her last name Ball
I look into her eyes, and I can see it all
I see it when she cry, I'm there when she call
'Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall
Kill-kill 'em all, die in the spirit of the war
Thinkin' what am I, be in spiritual fall
My lyric will leave you in physical awe
Miserable, pitiful, ridicule, typical
Chemicals swimming through the inner tube
Get in you, that be the end of you
Times are beginnin' new
Fuck what you done this about what I'm finna do
Motherfuck a 9 to 5
I rather do 10 to 2
Motherfuck pin a guy now I write a pinnacle
The government and satan is fuckin' identical
Kiss my ass, and suck my genitals, tabernacle, biatch!
Jump jump jump out a window
Let's let's let's jump off a building baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby

Hey! The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down 'cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone

Let's let's let's jump off a buildin' baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a buildin' baby1Embed
