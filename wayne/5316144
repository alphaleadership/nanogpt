Hahaha
This strict ass shit, ha
Nah I'm playin', you know we like the strip club
You a nasty ass motherfucker
Cállate, Mike Crook
You gon' walk up in that bitch
Scott Storch
You gotta throw hunnids, hunnids
 nigga stop playin'

How you fit it with a ass so fat? (So fat?)
How I'm 'posed to pass on that? (On that)
You bad and got racks on racks
You gon' make a old nigga have asthma attack
Go girl
Go girl, go girl, go girl (Go)
Go girl, go girl, go girl (Go)
Go girl, go girl, go girl (Go)
Go girl

Ass, ass, ass, ass
All in a nigga face when a bitch pass
Left hand thinking 'bout to grab
Right hand thinking 'bout to grab ass
How you fit all that ass in them jeans? (How you fit it?)
Fashion Nova stop playin' with me (Stop playin')
You glowed up girl, now you bling, bling, bling, bling, bling
Takin' care of your baby, that's a priority
So for these blue faces, she gon' buss it down for me (Buss it down)
Left cheek, right cheek, feel it on the D (Oh)
Still don't know how you fit it all up in them jeans (Oh)
That's what I don't know (Don't know)
But somehow she's able
She took a bag and did the Tootsie Roll, oh, oh, oh, oh
See YG LiveGet tickets as low as $170You might also like
How you fit it with a ass so fat? (So fat?)
How I'm 'posed to pass on that? (On that)
You bad and got racks on racks
You gon' make a old nigga have asthma attack
Go girl
Go girl, go girl, go girl (Go)
Go girl, go girl, go girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Go girl, go girl, go girl (Go)

Girl, you workin' with some ass, yeah
Pizzazz, yeah
Let me see you toot it up and make it it crash land
I'ma smack you on your ass, yeah
Backhand
I'ma eat that pussy fast, yeah
PacMan
Yeah, nasty ass nigga with a red flag
Walking 'round my mansion actin' like king, man
And she walking 'round ass out, Amen
I'ma fuck it when she leave, I'ma take some friends, Hallelujah
I pull up in the double R, feelin' like the governor
If I take this rubber off, she gon' do a somersault
I know what the money for, hit her with a hunnid some
I got lot of ass, lookin' like I run a hunnid yards
I said, "I'ma smoke alone"
Drinkin' like a mortar, huh?
If her ass pokin' out, I hit her with a Pokemon
She already had ass, she just got shots
I'm like "Damn, bae you know you wrong" (Know you wrong)
How you fit it with a ass so fat? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How I'm 'posed to pass on that? (On that)
You bad and got racks on racks
You gon' make a old nigga have asthma attack
Go girl
Go girl, go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl, go girl
Go girl

Ayy
Well it's that Westside long hair nigga with the bitches
Shake that ass, make it bounce, we could fuck in the Sprinter
I'ma go bad in it, she gon' wipe it when I finish (Ooh)
The pussy got no space, I'ma put a gap in it
Like Michael Phelps, I'ma swim a lap in it
Took off my belt, you been a bad-bad baby (Haha)
Control your bitch she been on my dick lately (Yeah)
On (Yeah), on (Yeah), on (Yeah), it's crazy (Ooh)
You don't got bitches like the ones I got, no
You don't pop bitches like the ones I pop, ayy
She wanna take half then ride my cock (Ride it)
I can't save a bitch, no Robocop (Ooh)
Diamonds in my ear, like a tater tot (Ice)
Rolls Royce keys on the tabletop (Cash)
She wanna taste me like the candy shop (Hmm)
Pow, pow, open up your mouth, ayy
How you fit it with a ass so fat? (Bitch)
How I'm 'posed to pass on that? (Yeah)
You bad and got racks on racks
You gon' make a old nigga have asthma attack
Go girl
Go girl, go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl, go girl
