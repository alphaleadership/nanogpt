Too good
Too good
Too, Too

One of the coolest to rep my sec
Only the foolish neglect projects
Coming from the newest and blessed by Tech
Clergy of cray's, worthy of praise
Like Anubis and Wepwawet
Dismiss what I play to thee
A Damu could muster wrong Suge
Slick spit from a hater see
All the crew stood of a strong wood
Mystics with the fate of T
Read I'll move hoods, bruh yo' song should
Critics what they say to me
Is that I'm too good for my own good
A lotta my people in circles 'round the hood
They treat my music like a blondie
Too much emotion and too many cadences
Thеy want you on the mic, a zombie
Lyrically against the ficklе listener
Quick to pistol-whip you like you're Chauncey
Then I step wit' a thickie like Ashanti
Spit a web of witty, quite Anansi
If you spit ridiculous and raise the bar up
They don't wanna reach it
And won't ever seek it
The moment I speak it
Don't wanna receive it
The one I'm alone at the top
You become so invisible to them
Your name don't spark up
Opponent I'll beat it, I'm only conceited
The dome it competed, the tone it retreated
They running, I'm gone and forgot
Rigorous fail when idols give it
Wicked as hell and pyro with it
Gibberish sells and I grow vicious
Nigga this Del in Hieroglyphics
Too good at a thing, you just might be shunned
I can't even do a Verzuz with none
'Cause I'm one of one
You might also like
I'm just too good for my own good
I'm just too, I'm just too
I'm just too good for my own good
I'm just too, I'm just too
I'm just too good for my own good
I'm just too, I'm just too
I'm just too good for my own good
I'm just too, I'm just too

What else can I do?
Standing next to you
But ruin your career
Exacerbate your fear
Make it so you can't ever ever ever ever come back around here

Uh
Too good, no I'm too great
I'm like two trey with the flu weight
Talking shit and outta toothpaste
Big Bs, Bobby Boucher
On my wrist I got the skeleton
Richie with the see-through face
Drive the whip without the toupee
Pregnant pistol got a due date
I'm too good for my own good
I cross my heart, I knock on wood
I lost my heart, I found my foot
I stand my ground, that ground I stood
I walk my walk, that ground is shook
That time I bought, that time I took
That time I put inside these thoughts
And since this art, they gotta look, look
I'm one of the boolest to rep my set
I don't do computers but I sipped High-Tech
I don't do computers but my chips like that
I don't do computers but my shooters put a bullet wound in ya apple
It look bit like MAC
Just like that, like this like that
My drip like splat
With lips like that, she kiss my gat
Just might blat
Beat the beat up
Like this track tryna fist fight back
When the producer heard this verse
It left his eye black
Ask my chef
I eat rappers, I like mines prepped
Still an ex-con feeling like the only icon left
That's real shit, I'm still the shit
I ain't wiped mine yet
The greatest of all time
And I got a lifetime left, Tunechi
I'm just too good for my own good
I'm just too, I'm just too
I'm just too good for my own good
I'm just too, I'm just too
I'm just too good for my own good
I'm just too, I'm just too
I'm just too good for my own good
I'm just too, I'm just too

It's crazy
Too good, too
Too good, too good, too
Too good, too good, too1Embed
