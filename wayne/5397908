It look so sexy when you do it 'cause you're doin' it good
I need all my babies, report to the parkin' lot
Chevys and Mercedes, everybody lean and rock
Snap ya fingaz, I see you doin' it
That's just how we do in my hood

I know you waitin' on another one
So girl here go the other one
Now grind on me while ya snap ya fingaz
Snap ya fingas, snap ya fingas
I know you waitin' on a special song
So you and your nigga can get it on
Now grind on him while ya snap ya fingaz
Snap ya fingaz, snap ya fingaz, yeah
