28 ContributorsWalk It Out (Remix) Lyrics
Haha
Drought 3
Yessir!
Hahaha
Look

I bought it out like Stunna
I hope when we kiss, we make you sick to your stomach
Stuntin' like my daddy, and your mama eat rubbers
I bet that I can do the mouth-to-mouth with your woman
My house is a dungeon
Yellow diamond ring looking like a little Funyun
Stand on my toes, you can call me "Paul Bunyan"
Switching up my flows like a nigga do construction
The microphone wet 'cause my words like seduction
And when we on the jet, you don't come up in the discussion
And if you say you balling, we probably don't trust you
And I know plenty freaky hoes that probably won't fuck you
Even if you pay 'em, boy, they probably won't fuck you
Only if I say that she can touch you, like Busta
But she might cut you, and burn you, like Usher
Me and my clique be in red, like Russia
I shit these rappers out, and sometimes, I forget to flush you
Grandaddy purp or bubble kush-crusher
Explode in a bitch mouth like a Gusher
Cash Money, Young Money, check the production
I am just a Martian, get prepared for abduction

Hahahaha
Hehehe
Hahahaha

Um, I walk it out, like crutches
Two girls jump me, like double-dutches
My nigga T-Streets know a girl named Duchess
And every time he see her in the street, she be cussing
I told him he should wave the black flag 'cause she bugging
He said, "The pussy good," he said, "You dig?" So I dug him
I'm looking for a real bad bitch with a husband
I'll give her much dick and a whole lot of nothing
I'm spitting like I stumbled on a gold pot of something
And when I was six, I saw my role model hustling
So I gotta hustle
These rappers talking 'bout a whole lot of nothing
You dropped me on Saturday, I sold out on Sunday
Fuck is the arguing 'bout? Nigga, Tha Carter out
This is what I call Da Drought... 3
And we don't walk it out, we drop-top-Porsche it out
They better walk 'em out, before we chalk 'em out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk 'em now
They don't want it, uh-uh; no, they don't want it, uh-uh
You see, they phony, I'm not; oh, yeah, they phony, I'm not
I Eastside walk it out, I bring New Orleans out
I am a Saints fan; oh, yeah, we marching now
Like we're a Saints band, I play the organs now
And if they talking, most likely, I'm what they talking 'bout
My nigga T from the East roll up that forest now
Man, I'm just trying to get my peanuts, I'm like Charlie Brown
OK, that Uzi make a Harley sound
Take two of these and walk around
Come straight from that homeless town
This game belong to Carter now, bitch17Embed
