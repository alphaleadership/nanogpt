28 ContributorsOnce In A While (Murder) Lyrics
It's your boy Max Biggavel
We wavy, wavy baby, on the wave, oww!
Why I always do that?
'Cause I had this over my head
So I said I figure you know
If I gotta go to trial, probably just go trial
At least I know a nigga out there holding it down, you know what I'm saying?
We was a part of something together my nigga
You killin' them, number one
Like he real wavey right now
 new records
It's no secret
You get the coke wave listenin' to him (Yeah)
Keep the jams on the radio
Macaroni & Cheese
I'm telling them
I already know how it's gonna go down
You feel me?
Nothin'
No evil used against us shall prosper (Woo!)
Who God blessed, no man cursed
And they say
Haan!
It’s what ya all been waitin for
It’s what ya all been waitin for
It’s what ya all been waitin for, ain’t it?
What people payin paper for?
It’s what ya all been waitin for
It’s what ya all been waitin for
It’s what ya all been waitin for, ain’t it?
What people payin paper for?

Getting shot up, then he got up
Came back then he lit the spot up
Homie hit the chart up
Moroccan boy, you sloppy boy
3 chains on, I be Rocky boy
Packs out the lobby boy
Nigga you can read on, East Tremont
Franks, got my feet on
With money I can lean on
Canary chain cold but still keep the heat on
Your bitch with the raccoon vest, Peter Pete on
Catch me at the game, hard wood where my feet on
Lookin for an actress on my wood I could skeet on
Mansion on the other hand, live from the mother land
2 straps on, east side, we ain't rumbling
Murder
Cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
My money on the line
(Murder was the case that they gave me)
Murder

Cold blooded murder

Alfred Hitchcock, two fear fist fight
Caught a nigga slippin for his chain and his wrist watch
Murder was the case that they gave me,
I can’t believe my boo bout to have my baby
Fuck, you outta luck, Mercedes truck
Pull up, distance, shoot better than Miller
Ducking from the narcs, Elsmere Crotona park
Out of control, now a nigga gon' control the market
Shoot outs and move out, ask the brick layers
Now I'm floor seats, talkin' to the bench players
Tell Mike Bibby, it’s my city
Leave the game, hit green house, me and Diddy
Murder
Cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
My money on the line
(Murder was the case that they gave me)
Murder
Cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
My money on the line
