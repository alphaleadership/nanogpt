Angels, Witches
Angels, Witches

Demonic, exotic, exotic, demonic
I pop Oxycodone like antibiotic
Textin' my phone, right now I'm on molly
It got me perspiring like I'm in Somalia
I should be more careful, right now I be wildin'
I could be more helpful, could not be more stylish
She could be my devil, she might be my goddess
It could be Satanic, it might be platonic
I tip my hat to her, she'd rather dollars
I drip a bath for her, she'd rather shower
She turned her back on me, I just massage her
Knew we were a match, didn't know we started fires
A bird is a plane? If it is, it's a private
Swerve in the lane, she either hit me or dodgin'
Meet me at the crossroads in the middle of rush hour
On end of the road, boys and men don't die

Yeah, angels and witches (Angels and witches)
Bengals and kittens, swingers and hitters (Yeah)
Singles and sinners (Yeah)
Ankles, physicians, the pictures, the painters (Buh)
The sick one, the sane one (Yeah)
The lit one, the lame one, the mistress, the main one (Buh)
The witch and the angel (Yeah)

You got me sleepless, sleepless in Miami (Yeah)
You got me twinkling, so bright, bitches tanning (Yeah)
You got me thinkin' that love may be magic (Yeah)
You got me beefing with your baby daddy (Pew)
You got me sleepless, sleepless in Miami (Yeah)
You got me sleepless when I'm on a xanny (Yeah)
You got me sleepless, it might be the Addy
You got me creepin' inside my own mansion
(But you got me sleepless, sleepless in Miami)
You got me sneakin' and I got you snapping
When we be sleeping, you topless, no panties
You let me sleep right behind you, you nasty
You let me sleep, deep inside you, you savage
We never sleep, when we try, we get nasty (Yeah)
You never dream, if you do, I'ma catch you
You say don't skeet, if I do you gon' catch it, you nasty

You got me sleepless (Sleepless)
Sleepless in Miami (In Miami)
Yeah, you cut me deep, yeah
Deep in thought while I'm deep inside of you
Damn, that's deep (That's deep)

Hate me, love me, love me, hate me
Kiss me, bite me, suck me, taste me
Been around the world and   I can't find my baby
I've been lookin' for the right one
Play one, wife one, main one, side one
Got a angel that I gotta die for
Adam, Eve, apple cider
Angel be killing me softly (Softly)
The witch, she be makin' it hard for me (Hard for me)
The witch on my broom, can't get off of it (Off of it)
She wear her halo with two horns through it (Woah)
Flap your wings, them shits vanilla white (Oh)
Feathers everywhere, no pillow fight (Oh)
My morning angel and my witch at night
Give me kiss of death, now I feel alive
