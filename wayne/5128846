3 ContributorsStupider Remix Lyrics
Yeah, Okay, it's the G mix nigga, Stupider

I gotta stupid sack, with alotta o's
And when I pull up, I'm with alotta hoe's
I gotta bankroll, stupid bankroll
I gotta bankroll, stupid bankroll

Anything goes, anything goes
I stay swagged up, I never wear the same clothes
One for the money, too many shows
I bought another chain, now I got 3 of those
Stupid Tit, I  stupid bad
And I'm high, bitch I'm on that superman
I'm in a supercharger, and it's super clean
2 stacks of  that's a stupid bean
Pinky ring pink, that's that stupid fruity bling
Duffle Bag Boys, we the stupid  team
You got a bad bitch, what ya goin to do with her?
Remix stupider, my outfit from Jupiter

Call me stupid man, I have a stupid plan
To get them stupid bands, got em with stupid hands
Go to my stupid spot, go to my stupid safe
Into my stupid coat, and now they stupid 
I got a stupid bitch, that pussy so dumb
Give her that stupid dick, that pussy so Young's
What's on my stupid finger? Maybe this stupid rock
We paying more than 26, now that's a stupid block
That was a stupid call, that was a stupid play
I tell that stupid motherfucker, "Happy Stupid Day"
It ain't nothing, Dolla, you know I got ya, Tit
Just leave it up to Young to say some stupid shit
Jizzle ya stupid homes, I'm on a stupid song
Know what I'm blowin on, some of that stupid strong
White and green stones, Kevin Garnett
Pull hamstrings, Rims upset
You might also like
I gotta stupid sack, with alotta o's
And when I pull up, I'm with alotta hoe's
I gotta bankroll, stupid bankroll
I gotta bankroll, stupid bankroll

They call me stupid fruity shawty, he got them stupid packs
Stupid Fruity shawty, he got a stupid swag
Stupid Fruity shawty, straight from overseas
Tell them no more ounces, baby all I sell is quarter keys
The braud said "Dolla, got a stupid ass wrist"
Told her Duffle Bag offset swag  bitch
Got them  on the Benz with a stupid ass nip
And a hundred fifty rounds, that's a stupid ass clip
For 36, I'm talking 32
Magic Johnson, I'm down with the Lakers too
I'm talking old school, like the baby blue
Sip purp, yellow stones, yellow gold too

Weezy in this bitch, stupid chain on my neck
Come a lil closer, smell the pussy on my breath
I gotta talk stupid, I'm a Young Money doofus
My niggas is retarded, and my bitches is the cutest
I'm a motherfucking psychic, because I know you like it
I tend to see things, like the motherfucking titan
Got these stupid ass Nikes, these stupid ass hoodies
Stupid ass don't like it, why ya stupid ass looking?
I gotta stupid Bugatti
And I can 1 wheel my stupid ducati
Haha, Stupid, Dumb and Crazy
And this is just a stupid ass Remix Babyy
I gotta stupid sack, with alotta o's
And when I pull up, I'm with alotta hoe's
I gotta bankroll, stupid bankroll
I gotta bankroll, stupid bankrollEmbed
