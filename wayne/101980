This is what we call, the movin' sidewalk
Let's see. What am I gon' wear today?
Movin' sidewalk, movin'-movin' sidewalk
This is what we call, the movin' sidewalk
Gimme them Cedar gloves
Movin' sidewalk, movin'-movin' sidewalk
I'm goin' into my cashmere closet
This is what we call, the movin' sidewalk
I got mo' cashmere than y'all
Movin' sidewalk, movin'-movin' sidewalk
Where my trousers?
This is what we call, the movin' sidewalk
Cream, brown, and 3-inch cuffs
Movin' sidewalk, movin'-movin' sidewalk
Where my sneakers?
I don't wear sneakers, I wear slippers

The rumor, of me in the Isuzu Trooper, fooled ya!
It was a Porsche, a super-duper
Charger, it wasn't Bankhead; it was Boulevardin'
Wasn't Shawty, it was comedian, naughty—
Uh-uh, that wasn't my car; I was walkin' in velvet slippers
Know you're talkin', but before you do, you need to know
That that's the type of brother got a castle with a cognac river
For a moat— I'll tell you what floats my boat
Purple silk linin' in all of my coats
What you want? You want cashmere in the winter?
Really wanna know my worth? Wanna know my splendor?
Before I deliver, gonna warn you: may offend you
Tesh-and-Kina this thang, while you just a Simba
Watch the beak on this penguin—his raps are sicker
I can weave in this lane, halogens'll flicker
Foreign somethin' sittin' in the back with drivin' gloves and wavin', lazy

Pimp mode (Pimp mode), meat good like pie à la mode (Ugh)
On parole, still keep me a calico ('Co)
Never them gym clothes, cut Hilfiger ('Figer)
Polo horses on my bed, pillow and spread
That girl want a wild bull between her legs ('Tween her legs)
Too much game for them squares and them lames (Them lames)
I'm in a wet car (Car), candy thang (Thang)
Cologne smell good, taste like a candy-cane (Ugh)
Lane to lane (Lane), brain to brain (Brain)
I wrecked the Spur (Spur), it really ain't no thang (Ugh)
I'm in red, brand-new, hoggin' the game (Game)
I got the Phantom, car's tuned true, just bought a Range (Range)
At press time, hadn't dropped the album yet (Ugh)
Chinese girls love me long time on the G4 jet (Jet, ugh, ugh)
Ugh, you hear that noise in my closet? (Closet)
That's the gator tryna talk to this chinchilla tryna touch the ostrich
We gon' paint the town tonight
They gon' faint and fall in line (yeah!)

Um— Microphone check, twelve, or just one-two (Yeah)
I am me— Who are— Fuck you!
And I'm one too high, you should look up to me
My French girls love it when we smoke the ooh-wee
(Translate!) Um bellan France adore when we smoke the ooh-wee (Haha)
I do me; she feel me comin' like new teeth (Ow)
Ugh, I got paper like loose-leaf (Shh)
Come over here and maybe you can get a few sheets (Hmhm)
My body's unique, like the Sistine Chapel (Yeah)
Fresh, like six green apples (Yeah)
I should cut myself to see if my blood's red (Ugh)
Baby, I brainstorm—call me "Floodhead"
Married to the money
And if she leaves me, bury me, money (Hm)
And when you're not good, then your arrogance is funny (Hey)
And when you're really rich, then asparagus is yummy
Weezy *Ffff* Baby
