2 ContributorsThinking To Myself (Her Eyes) (Demo) Lyrics
Oh, yeah, baby, you know who it is
So go on let me in
And you know, I ain't let your house door shut, baby, haha
This for you, baby

Yeah (Yeah), and I can smell her lookin' at I
She recognize real, I don't wear no disguise
And I can see it in her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes

I was gazin' out the window of somethin' foreign
Thinking to myself, sеlf
How come gettin' money nеver gets boring?
How come gettin' money never gets boring?
Girl, I got a stack, what you gon' do for it?
Can you bring it back like the motherfuckin' chorus?
Girl, I got a stack and I say, what you gon' do for it?
Can you bring it back, bring it back, bring it back?
Baby, I am hotter than Papa Bears' pourage
Honey, can I put my private parts in your storage?
I can treat your flower like a motherfuckin' florist
Shawty, we can kick it like my name Chuck Norris, haha, yeah

'Cause I can smell her lookin' at I
She recognize real, I don't wear no disguise
And I can see it in her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes (Hah! Ha)
She fuckin' me with her eyes (That what she doin', bruh?)
She fuckin' me with her eyes (Ha, CMB Mafia, ha)
Brisco, baby (Yeah! Yeah)


Yeah, 'cause I can smell her lookin' at I
She recognize real, I don't wear no disguise
And I can see it in her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
Brisco, baby


Hahaha, yeah, 'cause I can smell her lookin' at I
She recognize real, I don't wear no disguise
And I can see it in her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
She fuckin' me with her eyes
Brisco, babyEmbed
