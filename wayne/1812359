5 ContributorsCan’t Believe It (FP Remix) Lyrics
She hit the main stage
She make the people say, "Yeah"
Yeah, uh

I can put you in the log cabin
Somewhere in Aspen
Girl, ain't nothin' to the Pain
Ain't trickin' if you got it, what you askin' for?
Put you in the mansion
Somewhere in Wiscansin
Like I said, ain't nothin' to the Pain
We can change that last name, what's happenin'?
'Cause you look so good
Tell me why you wanna work here
I'll put you on the front page of a King magazine
But you gon' get yourself hurt here
Ayy, baby, I brought you in the back just to have a conversation
I really think you need some ventilation
Let's talk about you and me

Oh, I can't believe it
Ooh, ooh, she all on me, on me
Man, man, I think she want me, want me
Nah, I can't leave her lonely now
Ooh, I can't believe it
Ooh, ooh, she all on me, on me
Man, man, I think she want me, want me
Nah, I can't leave her lonely now
And you don't understand, she make the people say, "Yeah"
Yeah, yeah
She hit the main stage, she make the people say, "Yeah" (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah), yeah
See T-Pain LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like
I could put you in the condo
All the way up in Toronto
Baby, put you in the fur coat
Ridin' in the Murciélago
I'll put you in the beach house
Right on the edge of Costa Rica
Put one of them lil' flowers in your hair
Have you lookin' like a fly mamacita, fuego
'Cause you look so good
You make me wanna spend it all on you
Get up out this club
Slide with your boy and we can do what you wanna, yeah
Baby, I brought you in the back 'cause you need a little persuasion
Plus you need a little ventilation
Let's talk about you and me

Oh, I can't believe it
Ooh, ooh, she all on me, on me
Man, man, I think she want me, want me
Nah, I can't leave her lonely now
Ooh, I can't believe it
Ooh, ooh, she all on me, on me
Man, man, I think she want me, want me
Nah, I can't leave her lonely now
And you don't understand, she make the people say, "Yeah"
Yeah, yeah
She hit the main stage, she make the people say, "Yeah" (She make the people say)
Yeah (She make the people say, T-Wayne), yeah (Yeah)
Now I can put your **** out
Oh, keep runnin' your mouth (Mouth)
And if your brothers come trippin'
I'ma show 'em what these teardrops 'bout ('Bout)
Shawty, I was just playin'
Ooh, but I can take you to the Cayman Islands
Have you screamin' and hollerin'
We gon' be makin'
Love on the beach
The people see what we doing, oh
They pointing and ooh-ing, oh
But we gon' keep on doing it
Like it's just me and you and no one else around
It went down on the balcony
And her legs open, penthouse suite
Shawty like a model out the Penthouse sheets
That's why I got her on my penthouse sheets

And oh, I can't believe it
Ooh, ooh, she all on me, on me (She all on me)
Man, man, I think she want me, want me (I think she want me)
Nah, I can't leave her lonely now (And I can't leave)
Ooh, I can't believe it
Ooh, ooh, she all on me, on me (She on me)
Man, man, I think she want me, want me (She want me)
Nah, I can't leave her lonely now (No, I can't leave)
And you don't understand, she make the people say, "Yeah"
Yeah, yeah
She hit the main stageEmbed
