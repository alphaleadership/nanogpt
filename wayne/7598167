2 ContributorsBuild You LyricsVerse 1 (Kanye)
You got something that I never seen before
And I been around, I seen it all before
I got some money and it's all yours
Then after shopping it's the encore
Some things we just can't control
I play my part and you play your role
They say Ye throw tantrums like an 8 year old
Well that explains why I'm still out here dressing dolls
Hook (Kanye & Lil Wayne)
Girl I wanna build you (Let the beat build, bitch)
Girl I wanna build you (Let the beat build, bitch)
Girl I wanna build you (Let the beat build, bitch)
Girl I wanna build you (Let the beat build, bitch)
Verse 2 (Future)
If you wanna be mine you gotta spread that out for me
If you wanna be mine get naked in the house for me
If you wanna be mine you'll break up with your spouse for me
If you wanna be mine you'll break up with your spouse for me
You ain't the jealous type I got bitches coming in and out
I don't go on dates, take a private jet to In-N-Out
Take a xanny feel your breath going in and out
Take a xanny feel your soul going in and out
I take you with me wherever I go, you my groupie
I build you up whenever you fall, like how you do me
I still got other bitches on the side though
But that's the type of shit you turn a blind eye for
I can't lie girl I feel like you the one for me
I moved you out the slums and got you living comfortably
You a bad bitch I thought I seen it all before
I'm a savage, make a bad bitch feel it in her core

Verse 3 (Kanye)
I'ma have to mould you, I'ma have to mould you
Remember what I told you, remember what I told you
And your ex man, what your ex man gon do?
Let me control you, yeah let me control you
Dinner in Paris, that shit cray, for a normal nigga
Then breakfast in the hidden hills, of California nigga
You can tell your ex man, sayonara nigga
College dropout, but I get brain like a Harvard nigga
(Uh, yeah) And when I'm with you girl I feel like I'm on ecstasy
(Uh, yeah) We out in public, and I want your ex to see
(Uh, yeah) Balenciaga, Gucci, Louis, Prada
(Uh, yeah) I could make you into the new Madonna
(Uh, yeah) And all these niggas they bow down in my honour
(Uh, yeah) We don't need no drama, we don't need no drama
(Uh, yeah) Remember what I told you, remember what I told you?
(Uh, yeah) If I built you I can break you now put that on boo
