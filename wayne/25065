4 ContributorsWhatâ€™s Up Wit Dat Lyrics
Put a limit to the bullshit and give me some space
Nigga recognize the G in me when I'm the place
I'll get mad and deliberately spit in yo face
I ain't no pretty boy nigga I'm a felony case
My daddy was slangin' iron back in '78
Is you listenin' to a nigga, am I settin' you straight?
The next one of you niggas that come at me sideways
We'll be entertained wit' four or five K's
Probably might get killed in four or five ways
Probably won't be found for bout four or five days
Lil Wheezy in the pen for bout four or five days
Look he ain't in the hood fo bout four or five days
Better not tell me shit when I'm upset
Cause I'll catch a flashback and all of y'all would get wet
Around the way they call me Slap and Pop
Cause I'll slap a clip up in mac and let it pop

Look nigga, if you pull that bitch, you betta shoot that bitch
Reppin fo them hoes that get their wigs split quick
If you abusin' that shit, you probably shootin' that shit
I'm Mr. Bling Bling nigga fuck that shit
You could find me in my Rover gettin' head from a bitch
You could catch me on the block breakin' bread wit the click
You could find me in the lot buyin' a matchin' six
Lorenzo kit wit' buttons on that bitch
I hit a pawn shop and buy a gat for the click
Nigga ask the Ruff Ryders if you real wit it slick
I took them to the mansion that's paid out slick
Wit them Hummers, Bentleys and Jags and this bitch
I'm the numba one woadie I don't talk no shit
Look at all this ice and how I'm poppin' this shit
Nigga grease me up or I'll stick you up
Nigga put yo hands up before I fuck you up
See Juvenile LiveGet tickets as low as $81You might also like
Now what's up wit' dat
'Cause you know us don't play
We bust the gat
It got ice all over wit' dubs to match
You catch us on yo block late dressed up in black
Now what's up wit' dat
Now what's up wit' dat
'Cause you know us don't play
We bust the gat
It got ice all over wit' dubs to match
You catch us on yo block late dressed up in black
Now what's up wit' dat

It's like ruff, rugged, raw
Fuckin' on the interstate in a brand new car
For my niggas I'm ruff, rugged, wild
Strawberry Kool-Aid mixed wit' Cristal
Www dot fresh dot com
You deal wit' me Lil Daddy I guarantee you that I'm
Gon' put yo ass on front of a white T
XXL choker neck playboy or V

Now I be creepin' through the back wit the chrome plate in
Simmy auto, Tec let's get on baby
Now have they seen me in a seat Mercedes
Wit yo wife in a car wit' your babies
I'm a hot fire boy and I'm gonna let 'em burn
Straight from the 17th point of no return
And I squirm through traffic in a Porsche on factories
Hennessy in back of me, now I'm feelin' accurate
Ice blingin' hard suddenly the light captured it
Don't try me or yo mommy die from a freak accident
Oh no! Could've stopped, but I got this one big ol' 44, brr, pop
And I'm gonna chopped this whole ki into a lotta lumps
Next time you see me I'll have money like Donald Trump
I'm off the heezy it could be night, day I'm still creepin'
In a light grey Lamborghini, it's Lil Wheezy
Now what's up wit' dat
'Cause you know us don't play
We bust the gat
It got ice all over wit' dubs to match
You catch us on yo block late dressed up in black
Now what's up wit' dat
Now what's up wit' dat
'Cause you know us don't play
We bust the gat
It got ice all over wit' dubs to match
You catch us on yo block late dressed up in black
Now what's up wit' dat
Now what's up wit' dat
'Cause you know us don't play
We bust the gat
It got ice all over wit' dubs to match
You catch us on yo block late dressed up in black
Now what's up wit' dat
Now what's up wit' dat
'Cause you know us don't play
We bust the gat
It got ice all over wit' dubs to match
You catch us on yo block late dressed up in black
Now what's up wit' datEmbed
