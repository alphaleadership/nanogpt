Mum Mum Mum Mum
Mum Mum Mum Mum
Oh Woah oh oh oh
Can't read my
Can't read my
No, he can't read my polka face
She ain't got to love nobody
Can't read my
Can't read my
No, he can't read my polka face
She ain't got to love nobody
P-p-p-polka face
Mum Mum Mum Mum
P-p-p-polka face
Hey!

Womanizer-Woman-Womanizer
You're a womanizer
Oh, Womanizer
Oh, you're a womanizer baby
You you you are
You you you are
Womanizer
Womanizer
Womanizer
Boy don't try to front
I know just what you are
Boy don't try to front
I know just what you are
You! You say I'm crazy
You! I got your crazy!
You! You're nothing but a
You! Womanizer!
You might also like
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down
Hey!

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At-At-At night!

It's a quarter after one
And I'm a little drunk
And I need you now
Said I wouldn't call
But I lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how
I can do without
I just need you now

And I was like....
Baby, Baby, Baby
Baby, Baby, Baby
I though you'd always be mine
So, so what, I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what? I'm having more fun
And now what we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright, I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what, I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

And I like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake
When I'm asleep
Because everything is never as it seems
Blame it on the goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on the Tron
Got me in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the henny
Blame it on the blue-tap
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
Its like my iPod's stuck on replay
Stuck on replay
Stuck on replay
Replay
Replay
Replay-ay-ay

Baby, are you down?
Down? down? down?
Baby, are you down?

I'm only gonna break, break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break your heart
Hey!

Don't stop
Make it pop
DJ blow my speakers up
Tonight
I'mma fight
'til we see the sunlight
Tik Tok
On the clock
But the polka don't stop, no
Yodel-yodel-lady-hoo
Yodel-yodel-lady-hoo

P-p-p-polka face P-p-p-polka face
P-p-p-polka face P-p-p-polka face
Oh no, you can't read my P-p-p-polka face
P-p-p-polka face P-p-p-polka face3Embed
