Ear Drummers!
Turn up!
Ya not in
I said "Turn up!"
Woo!
Bitches and bottles
You know what is it
Ay (DJ Khaled!)

Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put in ice in your watches and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started

I’m turned up 'till my knob broke
You say turn it down I say "Nah, ho!"
My neck rocky like Balboa
My watch official, it's uncalled for
In the St. Regis on all floors
I got six sluts on all fours
They french kissin' say "Bonjour"
I got my own shine but I want yours
I'm stupid rich, got stupid bitch
Who stupid thick in Louboutin?
Don't like me? Fuck you again
Wanna fight me? Well, come do it then
Right hand to God on everything
I see the hearts of men and they very lame
I won't entertain no punk shit
They talk shit and I run shit
Boy, you tryin' to get what I been here
Hold it down for like 10 years
I’m gettin' it in til it's unreal
Let’s say one album and like ten mill'
Plus my swag is stupid low IQ
Hurt nigga feelin', I don't try to
But when you ballin' like I do
You know sucker niggas don’t like you, so—
You might also like
Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put in ice in your watches and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles (Uh), let's get it started

It's Tunechi, you bitch, you
I like sticky weed and sticky pussy
Sittin' on like a hundred mil'
I treat that shit like whoopie cushion
Ballin' on them fuck niggas
They on the bench I bench press 'em
They hating from the sidelines
They pissed off, piss test 'em
Man I'm on that lean
Liquor for the bitches
Who fuckin' wit' me? All I hear is crickets
I got stank up in my swisher
My bitch pussy smell like roses
She on that Molly, I'm on that Mary
I'm on that Mary like Joseph
Man I'm married to this shit
You can call it "Shit Carter"
Dick stay up like it got insomnia
All them niggas hatin', fuck ya in ya pussy
The best things in life are free
Free my nigga Boosie, gone
Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put in ice in your watches and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started

OK, now lil' nigga
My clique realer
Thick as fuck, I'm a big tipper
In the club 'bout 20 bottles
I make a movie like Ben Stiller
Chase money, don't chase hoes
That peach Ciroc, I'm on straight liquor
Neck froze like Cold Winter
Stand by me in need a chinchilla
Presidential got plenty rocks
Roc boy, like I know Jigga
Riding off in that new shit
I told the dealer you can keep the ceiling
Plenty bitches wanna get the business
I told them it's my dick decision
Goons with me, need supervision
Murk ya dog if it's slight tension
I hit once and my mind gone
Tipper's short, but my dreads long
See a star come make a wish
Come take a flick with ya camera phone
I'm in the club and I'm turnt to the max
Better be pretty, I'm turning 'em back
Clique full of riders you know where they at
R.I.P. Chris, I'ma end it with that
Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put in ice in your watches and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started

Ay, Let's order bitches and bottles (DJ Khaled!)
Let's order bitches and bottles
They're out of era, our models
They're out of era, our models (Let's go!)

Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up your cartridge, get the car that's exotic
Let's put in ice in your watches and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started

I make hits, I find hits
And I put hits out1Embed
