34 ContributorsAin’t Got Time Lyrics
Full of vanilla, flyin' over chocolate mountains
I stare at the Pacific while I'm smokin' on a kilometer
The feds, they hot on us, one hundred on the thermometer
They raided my private plane, I went got one that's more privater
R.I.P. Juice WRLD, wrote that on two cups
Cuz pour out a lil' juice for him, shit gave me goosebumps
Nigga been through too much, lookin' in the rearview to see the future

And that just don't sit right
Living like I can't die, Bumbu in me
FBI arrest me, why?
They can't nail me so thеy just screw with me
I just try, try to hide
Somеtimes it's hard to find time to be the good guy and still be someone
Enjoyin' my good times more than sometimes, and I just hope

I don't get time 'cause I ain't got time
I was high as fuck yesterday, damn, time flies
Where am I?
I admit I can't live when I think too much, too much on my mind
I don't get high, I got high
I was high as fuck yesterday, damn, time flies
Where am I?
I admit I can't live when I think too much, too much
You might also like
But sometimes I'm at home and I gotta focus (Gotta focus)
I told bae, "Someday, I could be gone, and you might have to post up"
Fuck what I'm talkin' 'bout, I run my mouth too much
Got too much on my mind, think about too much
Said, "It's our time to shine," then the clouds blew up
She said, "You better lock me down 'fore they lock you up"

And that just don't sit right
Living like I can't die, codeine in me
Just look through my girl contacts
I don't know what she see in me
I just try, try to hide
Sometimes it's hard to find time to be the good guy and still be someone
Enjoyin' my good times more than sometimes, but I just hope

I don't get time 'cause I ain't got time
I was high as fuck yesterday, damn, time flies
Where am I?
I admit I can't live when I think too much, too much on my mind
I don't get high, I got high
I was high as fuck yesterday, damn, time flies
Where am I?
I admit I can't live when I think too much, too much
Oh, yeah
Can't get a plane off the ground, I feel, sometimes
But even the weights get to bask in the sunlight
Are you really listenin'? We're waitin' for the punchline
Is anyone listenin'? I'm waitin' for the punchline
But I just don't have the time
Watch the flash, don't blink your eye
But my head hurts, ooh, don't lie
But I'm think I'm livin' right
But some shit just don't sit right
Shit just don't right
But some shit just don't sit right
It just don't sit right

And that just don't sit right
Living like I can't die, codeine in me
Just look through my girl contacts
I don't know what she see in me
I just try, try to hide
Sometimes it's hard to find time to be the good guy and still be someone
Enjoyin' my good times more than sometimes, but I just hope10Embed
