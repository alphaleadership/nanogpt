11 ContributorsBlame It (Extended Remix) Lyrics
Excuse me (Remix)
I think y'all need to bring a little bit
Of every type of liquor over here to the table, every bottle
We got Weezy, Bus, Pain and Jamie Foxx over here

Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feeling loose (Yeah)
Blame it on the 'Trón, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol (Teairra... Yeeaaahh!)
I can give it to your Hood, but that ain't the way I look
Pour then let me drop and mix it up with Ciroc
I'm for real, that's the team that I drink with
Hoes out of tabs work more then your pink slip
Rosa bottles (Bottles), Patron in the ace gon follow
Ya'll gonna regrat this tomorrow
I need a designated driver, I'm looking for my ride
Cause I I-I-I I-I I'm so tipsy
Blame it on the lime green apple martini
The sippin got me trippin walkin around in my bikini
Right off the shots at 13, boy I on that gasoline
So don't make me, make me, cost a scene up in here
I'm all about that Louie, and I ain't talking bad
They tryina take me down, pourin rounds in my glass
And you can see me on the fluit, Got a room they wanna show me to it
Nope, I ain't drunk enough to do it
You might also like
Aye, she said she usually don't
But I know that she front
Cause shawty know what she wan't
She don't wanna to seem like she's easy
I hear you saying what you won't do
But you know what we're probably gon' do
What you been feenin' deep inside don't lie
Now girl what you drinkin' gon' let it sink in
Here for a weekend thinkin' we can
See where we could be if we press fast forward
Just one more round and you're down I'd know it
Fill another cup up feelin' on your butt what
You don't even care now I was unaware
How fine you was before
My buzz set in, my buzz set in

Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Mami lookin good, mami see me
And now she step into the bar because she know she need me
Her favorite song on, body so appealin
And she sippin on me because she know she need the feelin
I make her feel good she call me 'Tron silver
Gotta have me in her body, no matter if it kills her
I get up in her body, I'm kind of like a coach boo
Mami feelin proper body's movin like it's supposed to
(LOVE) When I'm in it I make mami wanna dance more (Yeah!)
Now she dancin like she's fuckin on the dancefloor (Yeah!)
She movin like she wanna break 'em off
I keep her hot and sweaty till she wanna take it off
Baby girl you better sip slow
I'm dangerous when the bottle starts to get low
When shorty's knocked out from havin a ball
Just blame it on the al-al-al-al-alcohol, Yeah

Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Aye, I mix Patron with the goose, call that "Patroose"
Just give me 2 doors no roof, that's the cooch
I'm ballin' like swoosh, hatea's throw the deuce
Blowin' on the kush taste like Bluebarry Juice
Let me Buy You A Drank, Get Like Me
(Joc is ya Tipsy?) Shit, I might be
I'm tryina spark the combo, pronto, take ya to the condo
Get ya fron row, take us to the Gun Show
Heard I was hungo, beat'sha like a congo
Make ya cum slow, pull ya hair like Rapunzel
Come on, take a trip we can do this anywhere
We don't do commercials only private Air Fairs
We tare the fair shares, a shots this evening
You all up in my ear, without these heavy breathin'
Say My Name, Say My Name, fuck it
I guess the alcohol's to blame, I love it (Ha)

Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on who? Blame it on me
She drink till she sleep when she drinkin' on me
I live in the cup, I watch the ice sink
She sippin' all night on some shit that's light pink
You know they say, you are what you drink
But baby I gotta be Louis The Thirteenth
And I could talk to her, but nobody hear
Her liquor so good she don't go around beer
Yeah! And shorty got class
Shorty got class when she pour me in the glass
Hey! Shorty take me to the head
One more shot of me shorty be dead
He heh! And shorty just love drunk
She need a designated driver cause she love drunk
Hi there bartender what's your name?
Let me buy this woman a bottle of Lil' Wayne, yeah

Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol (Hey!)
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol (T-Pain)
Girl I know you feel good, just like you look
Couple more shots, you open up like a book
I ain't trippin' 'cause I'ma read ya
Shawty, I ain't trippin', I just wanna please ya
I'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty then you know
It's going down, we can go kick it like Judo
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream
So I made her say I, I-I-I
Now she got her hand on my leg, got my seats all wet in my ride
All over my ride
She look me dead in the eye, eye-eye-eye
Then my pants got bigga, she already knew what to figga
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, "Fuck, that nigga"

Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, catch me in a zone (WhooaWhooaWhoa)
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol (A-a-a the alcohol)
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol (Alcohol)
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol (Ohhhhh, the alcohol)
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Now to my ballas poppin' bottles with there Henny in the cup
Screamin', "Money ain't a thang", if it ain't, throw it up
In the sky
Hold your drinks up high
And to my independent ballas who can buy there own bottles
If you're lookin' like a model, when them broke fellas holla
Tell 'em bye
And hold your drinks up high

Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcoholEmbed
