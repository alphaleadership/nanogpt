2 ContributorsUnstoppable (Solo Version) Lyrics
You can talk all you want, but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd, and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable

You can talk all you want, but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd, and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Save your pity for tomorrow when I smash it like a ball
In the club, on the news, I'll be rockin' like a rock star
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable

So supersonic, almost ironic
I play it like a game of chess
You wanna ride like a queen?
Well here, you got the best
I've got the moves to the grooves
You want to imitate it, that's me
Yeah, that's me, uh-huh!

Wanna whip me something crazy faster than the speed of light
Show you the way an entertainer always gets them right
Gonna need a backup plan, I'm giving you a shot, watch me flip it now
Yeah, that's me, uh-huh!
You might also like
You can talk all you want, but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd, and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Save your pity for tomorrow when I smash it like a ball
In the club, on the news, I'll be rockin' like a rock star
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable

Now shake your body
Like you got the jungle fever rushing through your veins
We gettin' crazy and the club is banging through your brain
When I say jump, you jump, jump, it's knockin', knockin'
I wanna see you jump like this beat is rockin'

You can't ride my bracelet, kinda fancy, but it's how I play
You wanna come along and see, and holler at me
Maybe I lost it, maybe not, 'cause I got game like a burning flame
Yeah, that's me, uh-huh!

You can talk all you want, but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd, and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Save your pity for tomorrow when I smash it like a ball
In the club, on the news, I'll be rockin' like a rock star
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Fa-fa-fa-fa, follow the leader
Fa-fa-fa-fa, follow the leader
Fa-fa-fa-fa, follow the leader
Fa-fa-fa-fa, follow the leader

You can talk all you want, but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd, and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Save your pity for tomorrow when I smash it like a ball
In the club, on the news, I'll be rockin' like a rock star
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppableEmbed
