2 ContributorsBackpack Lyrics
You said “I come in peace” so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen
Listen, listen

Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

Before you came around, I was in a rut
Didn’t have a friend, didn’t know what it was
You taught how to dream and how to love
You’re my best friend please listen to me

You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen
Listen, listen

Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

Uh
Greetings, I fell from the sky
I’m from a different world I use JO as a disguise
My flying saucer crashed, I’m the only one that survived
I’ve only taking over this planet since I arrived
I’m in a backpack, I’m ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I’m an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they tryna capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
John’s world

You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen
Listen, listen

Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpackEmbed
