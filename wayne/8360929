1 ContributorWhat Will Happen To You? Lyrics
I'd ask them for names
But nothing’s got anything to do with my life
My life is just a pile of cardboard
There just ain't worth while me
Just when I thought I had it figured
You came and kissed me just the other day
And made things nice with me
I'll be coming home now
And now I think for the first time in a while
The first time I am ever going to see

What will happen to you? Oh, oh

And here I think about the rest of my life
And I am sure you know you’re going to be
The shining star of my life shining
Sun is broken on my face
And star shines on my bеd
And it hurts me so, so much
Even more whеn I see it coming

We're having this time tonight
All the people in the crowd
Grab a partner, take it down
So take it slow, you got nothing to lose
You can't stop me, you can't stop me when you are lost
Just take it down, take it down, take it down
It's just me against the music, its just me and me, yeah come on
So take it slow, you got nothing to lose
You can't stop me, you can't stop me when you are lost
Come on and test me I'm here to take it back
Oh, let’s bleed this feeling
You might also like
What will happen to you? Oh, oh

You’ve got the look of love in your eyes (Mula!)
Now you've got the look of love in your eyes (Hey, oh, love)
Now you’ve got the look of love in your eyes (In your eyes)
I need some love, I need some rain, I need some sunshine (Sunshine, sunshine)

What will happen to you? Oh, oh

The feeling, the reasoning, the people, and the children
Oh, ah, nah, I don't wanna feel again, I don't wanna die
I wanna live until I cry, ayy-ayy, no-no-no, I don't wanna die
No more, enough is enough, what the hell is you on? Yeah

What will happen to you? Oh, oh

You’ve got the look of love in your eyes (Mula!)
Now you've got the look of love in your eyes (Hey, oh, love)
Now you've got the look of love in your eyes (In your eyes)
I need some love, I need some rain, I need some sunshine (Sunshine, sunshine)
'Cause we've changed, that's up to us
I've got so much more to share
I was walking down your street
When you whispered in my ear, I felt my whole word change
And i've had enough of your bullshit, it's time for me

What will happen to you? Oh, ohEmbed
