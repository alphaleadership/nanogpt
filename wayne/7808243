1 ContributorHow To Love(Bell Hooks Interpretation) LyricsCut the music up
A lil' louder, yeah
You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love, mmm
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love
How to love, mmm
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love (had a love)
Never had love (had a love)
When you was just a youngin', your looks werе so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blеssing
But you, can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love, mmm
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
Mm for a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
How to love
Oh, and you had a lot of dreams that transformed to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But, but I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You seen a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love, mmm
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
Oh, see I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You're far from the usual, far from the usual
You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
Mm see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love, mmm
See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
Yeah, see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love, mmmEmbed
