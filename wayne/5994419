(Saucy on the beat)
(L-L-L-Lethal)
Red rag, burgundy flag, all that
I'm finna bleed this bitch

I be blood, blood, blood walkin'
While I'm blood, blood, blood talkin'
I be blood, blood, blood walkin'
While I'm blood, blood, blood talkin'
I be blood walkin' and I'm blood talkin'
Got a red rag on me, got the strap on me, woah
What's brackin'? I'm an eastside nigga, I get active

Blood walkin' of the hip, clip talkin'
Baby case shells, kickflippin', Tony Hawkin'
When I die leave the flag in the coffin
Pimpin' in the red uniform, blood walkin'
Gangs sings in they photo, but I get the dough, though
I'm so berious they call me Barry Oso
When the hood was hot you was never loco
Clown face emoji, nigga, you's a bozo
I got the cheese, thе YG's do the beef
They in the fiеld, bottom of the cleats (Bottom of 'em)
Caught him by a Shell, straight E (Straight)
Put that on some though, Piru street (Street)
Big B rollin' twenty in peace
For all the red homies, I smoke, I drink (I do)
Stay with the heat like I stay with a freak (Woo)
In the function (Woo) twistin' all my fingers on B
You might also like
I be blood, blood, blood walkin'
While I'm blood, blood, blood talkin'
I be blood, blood, blood walkin'
While I'm blood, blood, blood talkin'
I be blood walkin' and I'm blood talkin'
Got a red rag on me, got the strap on me, woah
What's brackin'? I'm an eastside nigga, I get active

All-red handkerchief, Blueface Franklins
Ghostface Killah with the all-mink anklelength
Tool belt on underneath for my maintenance
Two redbones, fuck 'em each simultaneously
I be B-walkin', no baby steps
Niggas actin' like they hard, they just raise the net
My Slime brazy, Slime still get a brazy check
Big B, triple OG, and rated X
White diamonds, rose gold, red Patek
Countin' all the blood money, you done caught me red-handed
I'ma pull up, red truck, niggas call me Redd Sanford
I'ma hop out with the toaster lookin' for the breadbasket
Blood'll leave a nigga bleedin', Suwoop business
Lil' nigga, this a business meetin'
Bickin' back, bein' bool with Badu on, nigga
I Piru on everything, I put my shoe on, nigga, Lil Tunechi
I be blood, blood, blood walkin'
While I'm blood, blood, blood talkin'
I be blood, blood, blood walkin'
While I'm blood, blood, blood talkin'
I be blood walkin' and I'm blood talkin'
Got a red rag on me, got the strap on me, woah
What's brackin'? I'm an eastside nigga, I get active19Embed
