8 ContributorsRock & Roll DJ LyricsIt's time to hit the road, you're staying back at home
I'm gonna miss you so, but I gotta leave
I won't be all alone, got someone else to go
With me, it won't be the same, but all I need is a beat
So now I'm at the show, holding my microphone
Not up here on my own, tryna make them dance
New city every night, sold out, I'm getting by
One other member in my garage band
My rock and roll DJ
It's my rock and roll DJ
My rock and roll DJ
My rock and roll DJ
Go DJ, that's my DJ
Go DJ, that's my DJ
Go DJ, that's my DJ
Go DJ, that's my DJYou might also like1Embed
