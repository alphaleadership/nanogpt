(Red bandana)
I got to have my (Red bandana)
You know I got to keep my (Red bandana)
I eat and sleep with my (Red bandana)
It's Su-wu with my (Red bandana)
I got to have my (Red bandana)
You know I got to keep my (Red bandana)
I eat and sleep with my (Red bandana)
It's su-wu

Young Money, su-wu till I'm a dead man
Whatever color I wear, I gots to keep my red rag
Lumberjack button-up and my red paid
Eastside Blood, you can tell them Streets said that
I been eating, I don't think I'm gon' get full
Itchy trigger finger, you trippin' you thinking I won't pull
Took the rust off my flow like I was steel wool
When I rap, I give you wings, lil' homie, I'm a Red Bull
I play the cuts hard, so never mind the corner
And seeing a hundred G's only made me grind harder
I play to win life, we losing in the final quarter
Chrome nine line a motherfucker, that's my fire starter

(Red bandana)
I got to have my (Red bandana)
You know I got to keep my (Red bandana)
I eat and sleep with my (Red bandana)
It's Su-wu with my (Red bandana)
I got to have my (Red bandana)
You know I got to keep my (Red bandana)
I eat and sleep with my (Red bandana)
It's su-wu
You might also like
Two seater a red blur when I ride by
Piru and Damu, keep your head high
A lotta niggas go to ducking when that lead fly
Infrared beam, don't let me catch you with my third eye
Candy apple 'Rari, nigga, hold your horses
Red chuckers when you see me, hopping out the Porsches
I live a fast life, but always keep it focused
Red bitch top drop in a red Lotus
A lotta niggas rep this shit for no reason
Throwing up the flag and don't even know the meaning
What up, cuz? Nah, blood, I'm just teasing
It's su-wu, bitch, like my handkerchief bleeding

(Red bandana)
I got to have my (Red bandana)
You know I got to keep my (Red bandana)
I eat and sleep with my (Red bandana)
It's Su-wu with my (Red bandana)
I got to have my (Red bandana)
You know I got to keep my (Red bandana)
I eat and sleep with my (Red bandana)
It's su-wu

Fuck you tal'm 'bout?
I can see these bitch niggas ain't got no futures like they palms out
And if these bitch ass niggas be on their bullshit pull their horns out
I gotta red bitch, her name is Rose, I pull her thorns out
We been doing this shit for way too long Young Money all day
This the winning team and I'm the coach, bitch I just call plays
I live by the water in the big house with them tall gates
I'm the cash cow, now watch me milk this shit like cornflakes
I don't give a shit about shit, if it ain't my shit, that shit ain't shit, shit
Keep that click click, pow pow on the side like a mistress
T-shirt whiter than Hannah Montana
With my Red Chuck Taylors Skinny Jeans and my motherfuckin'
(Red bandana)
I got to have my (Red bandana)
You know I got to keep my (Red bandana)
I eat and sleep with my (Red bandana)
It's Su-wu with my (Red bandana)
I got to have my (Red bandana)
You know I got to keep my (Red bandana)
I eat and sleep with my (Red bandana)
It's su-wu1Embed
