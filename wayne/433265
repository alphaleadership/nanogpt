Now I don't wanna step out tonight
What do you think about that?
Does it soudnd like a plan?
And I don't wanna fill out a crowd
And I got a nice home and with a bed
And a nighty to match

Let's just so, let's just so, let's just so
Let's have a champagne chronic nightcap
(giggles)
Light the dro, sip on mo’, let's just so
We'll have a champagne chronic nightcap
What you feel about ... just
Oohh (Oohh)
Oohh (Oohh)
Oohh (Oohh)
Don't you wanna elevate, babe
It could be so great babe (I think it'd be great, baby)
Oohh (Oohh)
Oohh (Oohh)
Oohh (Oohh)
Don't you wanna take me higher
Take me higher

So this is an occasion so light
The candles, let’s live for the night
And you bring up the life
Cause honey I'm no blazer, alright
But I know to keep up the hour and just live for awhile
So what you think about that?

Let's just so, let's just so, let's just so
Let's have a champagne chronic nightcap
Light the dro, sip on mo’, let's just so
We'll have a champagne chronic nightcap
Listen baby, yeah

Listen I don't wanna feel no pain, no baby
The trials of another day just seem to fade away
When it's just me and you, good ooh-woo
Maybe a drink or two baby
Let's make these walls toxic hey yeah

Ha, yeah, I'm with you
My shovel get me to your level cuz I dig ya
I, Stevie Wonder, ponder, think, figure, dream of you daily
Why would I kid you, I'd rather practice making a kid
But I'm full to the leg, yes, maybe baby but I dig ya
Carter creates chemistry with charisma
Now maybe it's the chronic we twist up
See we can get high, I hope we get stuck
Now do you, you got that ooh-woo, swisha sweet
Make me wanna L-I-G, you are, no bar
We can talk about the war, what's right and wrong
Cry, write songs, count the stars, and that you so are
I can make tonight so good you wouldn't want to see tomorr'
You're chief! Yeah, you feel me baby?
Sometimes (sometimes)
I just want it to be
Me and you
Me and you (I agree)
And some good ooh-woo
Just me and you and some good ooh-woo
(I can definitely second that baby)
Just me and you and you and you and you

Yo chief
Yeah, what you talkin bout?
Can you pass me that umm...
Of course, of course you would
That good ooh-woo
Look at you
Yeah, just for the night baby
Just for the night
Now c'mon over here and just...
You got it

Let's just so, let's just so, let's just so
Let's have a champagne chronic nightcap
(laughter)
Light the dro, sip on mo’, let's just so
We'll have a champagne chronic nightcap
