14 ContributorsKobe Bryant (2020 Version) Lyrics
Okay, Ko-Kobe doin' work, two-four on my shirt
He the greatest on the court, and I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the fourth ring like it was the first
Gotta get the gleem, do it for Kareem
Two-four so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldstein
Ko-Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings
Ko-Kobe in the game dunkin' on the whole team, yeah
Bla-Black Mamba, attack, conquer
The basketball beast, ra-rap monster
The crossover good, the turnaround jumper
Or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's goin', it's goin' down, yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown, though
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show

Watch me get 'em like Kobe, yeah
Sick with it, no COVID, yeah
Black clouds break open, yeah
Rain down black roses, yeah
I smell the rose, now I'm focused, yeah
The game is cold, but I'm frozen, yeah
The lanes are closed, but I'm bowling, yeah
All Mamba, no cobras, uh
All around, no borders, uh
All eyes take notice, uh
Recognize my importance, uh
Never die, I'm immortal, uh
Got the culture on my shoulders, uh
See the vultures flying over
Now we marchin' like we soldiers
'Til we walkin' like we strollin', yeah
Sixty points in my last game like that's game, yeah, yerr
Put five rings on my last name, Oscar could've been my first
On one leg, on my last leg, I want the last shot, that's work
No Achilles Heel, I told Phil, "It's the last dance, now twerk"

Heart gold, beatin' out my chest, and it goes rat-tata-tata
This is Black entertainment, baby, this is Black power status, yeah
Two fingers for the Mambacita, I'm screamin' Black Mamba matters, yeah
Heart goes out to Vanessa and the whole Black Mamba family, BMF
Heart is gold, it's beatin' out my chest, and it goes rat-tata-tata, yeah
This is Black entertainment, baby, this is Black power status, yeah
Two fingers for the Mambacita, I'm screamin' Black Mamba matters, yeah
Heart goes out to Vanessa and the whole Black Mamba family

BMF, on BET, yeah, we the best, yeah
We the best, on G-O-D, yeah, Weezy F
Weezy F, yeah, G.O.A.T. like Kobe B
Rest in power and hope for peace
Black lives matter, facts
That's a matter of fact
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah3Embed
