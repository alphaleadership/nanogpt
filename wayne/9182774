1 ContributorHOT WIND BLOWS (Demo) Lyrics
I'ma travel the globe, you keep the block hot
Driver, open the door for me, my hand hurt
Find us, we playin' hide-and-seek with the passport
I like strange black girls with poofy hair on them
Stay low, the paparazzi herd on 'em (Yeah, woo)
Treat 'em like that all girl uniform, and skrrt on them
Shit is sweet, syrup on 'em
The French toast, but it's dinner time, we waive cars and dip boats (Yeah)
See he the Flower Boy, he got the roles in him (Roles in him)
He got garage too, and he got the Rolls engine (Rolls engine)
He kicked off at the GRAMMY's, he got some more in him (Some more in him)
See he ain't think he woulda made it, niggas was goaltending (Goaltending)
You niggas scared as a bitch, see that's the whole difference (Whole difference)
Everything I do head first, you dippin' toes in it (Yessir)
No socks, no shoes, I put my soul in it
What you niggas make is the shit that depends like old women
Bada-bada-bada, somethin'-somethin'-somethin'
Treat that last part like you niggas ain't sayin' nothin'

(Hot wind)
Yeah, one take
First take
Uh
You might also like
Excuse me, pardon me, the wind, it blow so hard at me
Like mother nature arguing about some baby father beef
And I'm stuck in the middle of the sandwich like slaughter meat
Got my middle fingers to the cameras that's recording me
From y'all to me, brrt, stop callin' me unless you're ordering
I'm on the beach, I got my feet out, and I stay on my feet
The corner beat, I'm on a deep route, just throw the ball to me
Thought all this lean would have me senile, I guess they see now
Let's touch down, catch a beat-down like I catch touchdowns
I fuck 'round and slow the beat down and take the drums out
And speed up my flow, I'm so greedy, I'ma eat my own flow
And I'm in need of a flow, might eat me a rapper and I might as well eat me a ho (Oh)
I'm hot as hell when the weather is freezin', as cold as the devil and demon and ghost
I'ma get even and even, get even some more, it's too late to even get low, baow
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, that's what I need you to know, Mula, Weezy the G.O.A.T
The wind beneath my wings, Desert Eagle underneath my coat
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Mula (Bitch)
