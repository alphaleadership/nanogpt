2 ContributorsEat Lyrics(Lil Wayne)
On  my daddy soul, that nigga shirt says the best rapper alive with a picture of me on that motherfucker
(Richie  Rich)
Started chasing every day now I got money for years
Had to go and get a bag got tired of mama crying tears
Had  to take over the wheel gassed it up and switch the gears
Knock  a nigga on his ass like a game of musicals chairs
Spin the bottle so I can see who these bullets kissing first
Bottle  landed back on you in UNO that is a Reverse
This Is called Russian roulette  I’m just her collecting debt
Take the I G E T A B A G out the alphabet
And yeah I’m still getting the work from a Mexican bullets eat a nigga flesh it don’t matter which vest he in
I’m  thinking of a couple ways for me to go and benefit
And Now I’m running up a bag it’s boosting my adrenaline
I’m in my prime number 8 Kobe Bryant
I’m the king of this shit cause I was raised with the lions
My heart still jump a beat whenever I hear police sirens
Cause i’m breaking down plants it look like I am doing science
My teacher told me that I wasn’t gone amount to nun
But now I’m flexing on that bitch and got more money than her son
I love my enemies and pray for those who persecute
You tried to kill me pussy nigga but you didn’t execute
Survivals my only hope success is the best revenge
He always there by my side Ben Franklins my only friend
The hundreds that’s in the vault are the ones that I don’t spend
Provided a lifestyle that got me living high end
I’m sitting in my condo my blunt filled with that hydrazine
I’m watching the Houston rockets play against my favorite team
I got them all lined up fucking bitches like Charlie sheen
I Kick em out when I’m done they already know my routine
I tell her pull my pants down and say hello to woody
I hate repeating myself like you didn’t understand fully
Gorilla in the mist with King Kong sized clips
If you coming to my hood that’s a school field trip
That’s the zoo On the corner them my lions and the loose
We got cigs, we got Caine, we got boof 10 for 2
Bullets have a nigga dancing look like he doing the shoot
Bishop off of juice keep a Smith & Wesson in my boot
We on every fucking corner like a Metro PCS
I’m gripping heavy metal I’m not doing a bench press
Be careful with yourself because the body is a temple
I’ll probably shock you if I told you everything I been through
Apples fall, Birds fly, We all live, and We all die
We buy guns, bullets fly, People die, Mamas cry
Outside summer time, guns bussing, babies crying, police sirens, I’m just praying to the motherfucking sky
But he never answer I’m staring to have some disbeliefs
Why he never answer when you call on him riddle me
If I ever seen Jesus I’ll fuck around and rob him
And he can take his problems to his mother fucking father
Since marry is a virgin think it’s time for me to fuck her
Conceive the baby In Atlanta name him Donald Glover
Every nigga that laughed at me is asking for a feature
I just tell them that I’m better and stick up my Malcom finger
I don’t fuck with goofy niggas or clown ass hoes
Separate the fake from real I’m good at ratios
Going through an episode where is the remote
I know the world is mine I use to tell it to a globe
After watching scarface he became one of my idols
Until my brother told me I got more verses than bibles
I’m not gone freeze up like Jr Smith did in the finals
Cause when it’s time to ride I’m going ape shit on my rivals
Bitch I’m standing taller than lil uzi on his money
I wipe my nose with hundred dollar bills when it get runny
I got to many hoes it’s kinda hard to keep up with them
Before I sit and eat i say my prayers father amenYou might also likeEmbed
