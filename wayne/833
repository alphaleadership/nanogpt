40 ContributorsScarface Lyrics
All I have in this world, all I have in this world (What up, Blood?)
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

They know where Carter at, straight off the launchin' pad
Marchin' on the moon motherfucker, I been to Mars and back
Cleaner than laundry mats, jumpin' in somethin' from
Other countries, companies, junkie, you cannot order that
I flew that and took the water back, order, go to Iraq
And get a car with gas and tell them crackers, "War with that"
All I need is an automatic: tick, boom
I'm a goon, I go zoom; smell the fumes from the vrooms
Young Tune in the room, gimme room or you doomed
I am soon to get all my chips and doubloons
I would never be another groom unless I assume
The bitch ain't givin' up the womb to him and whom
M.O.B, let me bloom, let me boom
I pop early like firecrackers in the last week of June
I'm gettin' my lunch like noon, I gotta eat
Scarface with diamond teeth, haha!

On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
Nobody know my name, they only know my face
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
Nobody know my name, they only know my face
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface

Lord, protect me from my friends, I can take care of my enemies
I come from where the niggas just kill to save energy
Sorry world, but my mommy dropped me where the clinic be
So if you tried to mimic me, you'd prob'ly catch some sick disease
Six degrees, leanin' on that prometha-tha-tha-thazine
I'm a centipede, these men move at women speed
I'm 'bout my spinach, cheese, dough, cheddar, fetti, gwap
Money, moolah, mozzarella, et cetera, et cetera
Fuck competitors, fuck these rappers, fuck these editors
Fuck the head of the state, fuck the gates surroundin' the prisoners
These motherfuckers the prey; I'm the Predator, see me dreadlock
Tough as Bamm-Bamm from Bedrock
I'm tied to the game like wedlock, say "Hello red dot"
Say "Goodbye life" and say "Hello Satan"
A devil in the flesh, a rebel at its best, no complainin'
We live in Hell and I'm blessed, Scarface

On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
Nobody know my name, they only know my face
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
Nobody know my name, they only know my face
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
Nobody know my name, they only know my face
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
Nobody know my name, they only know my face
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface6Embed
