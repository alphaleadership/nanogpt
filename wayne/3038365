What I tell ya?
Uh

I'm too sexy for your shit, uh
I don't take flexin' from no bitch, oh, no bitch
And my new bitch don't give me no lip
And when she do, she give me both lips, she ride it like a road trip
I got you on your mad shit, so now you doin' mad shit
I'm subtractin' ratchets, I'm outchea doin' math
Bitch, you ratchet on your best day, fuckin' for a check, face
Outchea leakin' sex tapes, why you tryna flex, babe?

Tell me why, would I sit up waitin' on you?
Would I sit up waitin' on you, yeah

Should have fucked you and cut you right up like a knife
Like all of my homies say you wasn't right
Like all of these bitches wanna fuck with a Crip
All in my kitchen, they lovin' my whip
All of these bitches wanna fuck with a real one
All of these bitches wanna fuck with a thug
All of these bitches wanna fuck with lil' Gudda
I show 'em the dick and I show 'em no love
I ain't trippin', bitch, I'm chillin', thirty hoes in the villa
Got a Ghost and a Wraith, call me Ghost Wraith killer
Call me Ghostface Killah, cash rules everythin' around me
I was a real nigga when you found me, I fuck 'em then I get 'em from around me, go

You know I, I been on the road
You been out doin' the most
Came a long way since I put you in designer
Waitin' in that line with your credit card declinin', oh
I don't know how I'm supposed to feel
Girl, you had a good thing, you fucked it up, you know
Ain't no text backs so you know it's real, yeah
