Ice Age

Oh, oh
You can be my cuddy, cuddy buddy, fo' sho' (You can ride with me)
Girl, don't act like you don't already know (Act like you don't see)
We can get it on the bed or the floor (Don't matter to me, girl)
I wanna take you to H-Town
You can be my cuddy, cuddy buddy, fo' sho' (You can ride with me)
Girl, don't act like you don't already know (Act like you don't see)

I wanna take you to H-Town (Mike Jones!)

Girl, if you need this here, call me, don't have no fear
I wanna (Love you down, l-l-love you down)
Lay nice and lovey-dovey, someone that'll love to love me
She's somethin' like a friend, call her my cuddy buddy
Even though she got a man (Woah)
She already know the plan (Woah)
She already know the deal, so what the business is?
Even though she (Got a man, woah)
She already (Know the plan, woah)
She already know the deal, know the deal, know the deal (Woah)
Even though I'm chubby, chubby, your chick, she love me, love me
She might be with you now, but she still thinkin' of me
Y'all out there making love, I couldn't make 'em love me
In the back of the 'Lac, hit it just like that

Move your hips like that, work your ass like that? (Like that)
Why you make noise like that
Move slow like that, fuck fast like that? (Like that)
Baby, I ain't gon' lie to you (Yeah) We so sexually compatible (Yeah)
How I thrill myself, I could kill myself
When I feel myself inside of you (Yeah)
You can be my cuddy buddy, nibble on my Nutty Buddy
While we do some freaky things with the lights on
Touchin' on you while I'm listenin' to T-Pain (Woah)
Huggin' on you while I'm listenin' to Mike Jones (Woah)
Do it soon as we got in the sack
Or I could hit it in the back of the 'Lac
Off a fifth of the 'gnac like (Like) like (Like) that (Like, yeah yeah)
It's the middle of the night, y'all got into a fight
Now you mad with your feelings hurt
Girl, let me buy you a drink, please tell me what you thank
Right before I get up in them skirt
