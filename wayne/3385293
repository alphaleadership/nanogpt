Bet you never felt like this ma
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Whats up shawty, my name is Weezy
Weezy Baby
Please say the Baby, when you say it or don't say it at all
How you man? Whats really good shawty
Please let ya hair down sit back and listen to me, man

I got that chrome sittin on my haul
Get it and roll let me see if it shed in ya soul
And I'm seeing what you need and I'm thinkin It's me
By you being a gangsta bitch and me being a G
All I see is kids, say my name if you wanna deal
Shawty we can play the hearts and i, swear i won't renig
I'm for real, and i'm there for all the things we didn't spend
But baby, I'm a hustla i had to get it in
I'm a love ya and for that we can win
Ya feelin my grin although as often seen
But nall I'm not mean I'm ya boy
I got ya you got me really do
You pretty, i ain't tryin' to see you in no videos, serious
Promise you'll never find another human like i
One who have the power to take over minds
One who have the power to take over minds
Let inside mama, my name is...

My name is Weezy Baby, Baby, Baby
My name is Weezy Baby, Baby, Baby
My name is Weezy Baby, Baby, Baby

See i don't know if you get it yet
But I'm lightin' dro up like cigaretes
The world is so cold and i gotta little chest
I need a lil miss to help me miss a lil mess
I give a lot of love and get a little stress
I'm best at being Weezy, so that's who i be
So know that you ain't fall In love with a G
You fell in love with a G
I'm spellin' love with a E and a O, oh, you play
U see It, when i send it over the two way
Oh babygirl, I'm too straight
It ain't sweet, but it's kool aid
What i mean it is as sweet as you make it
Take it to the house
I take you from girl to wifey
Than take it to the spouse
What we got is great and for snake bitin'
Take it to the mouth
The hatzas is nothing
Save the drama for your momma
Just save me lovin' trust and I'm a go and take it for us
If i never made love, I'm a make it for us
Baby, I can't see my world (I can't see)
Living here on God's green earth (God)
You don't know what you've done to me (Done to me)
I never thought I'd need you desperately (Desperately)
It's kind of sick how I'm stuck on you (Stuck on you)
But I don't care 'cause I'm needing you (I'm needing you)
And how I feel will remain the same (Remains the same)
'Cause you're my baby ('Cause you're my baby)

And when the world starts to stress us out (Yes)
I jets us out to a spot where it is just us now (Yes)
We connect on every play, shawty, that's touchdown (Yes)
We like Jlo and Puff  a been thats us now (Yes)
Weezy Baby, easy baby, settle down (Settle down)
My momma say to settle down discuss wedding vows (Ha-ha)
Let me find out, you got a playa callin time' out (Oh)
But a veteran just resigned out (Weezy Baby)

My name is Weezy Baby, Baby, Baby
My name is Weezy Baby, Baby, Baby
My name is Weezy Baby, Baby, Baby
My name is Weezy Baby, Baby, Baby
