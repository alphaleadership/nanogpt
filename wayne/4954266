4 ContributorsIn The Club Lyrics
Squad tryna get rich quick
Don't forget it motherfucker
Eh Weezy, come on
Party cause my squad up
In New Orlans
We gon party, yep yep in the worst way
Eh yo shawty, I'm tryna fuck on the first day

You can find me in the club, pocket full of blunts
To the HIV, 
And I'm into getting head, I ain't tryna love and fuck
 help me get stuck
You can find me on the block, fist full of rocks
And with my hand on my Glock, that shit gon pop
And I don't stop, till your man on top
 laying on top, yeah

Streets!
When I pull up out front, we gon rush the club
Everybody know I'm buck, so they usually show me love
Got that tooly full of whole slugs, if a nigga hold a grudge
When you fuck with Weezy baby, you got the hoes in love
Get the lute and run, this is T-Streets, motherfucker
Keep your eyes on my piece while I speak, motherfucker
I eat, sleep shit trouble
A nigga ain't crazy, I just want my shit double
She can't be my lady, I just want them lips from them
She gon do my clique, or 
Just  spent
Sittin on the hood, 
Flippin up your hood with thhe fullest
How your bitch gon say 
We just good, getting it good
That's why I bring the hood to your home, motherfucker

You can find me in the club, pocket full of blunts
To the HIV, 
And I'm into getting head, I ain't tryna love and fuck
 help me get stuck
You can find me on the block, fist full of rocks
And with my hand on my Glock, that shit gon pop
And I don't stop, till your man on top
 laying on top, yeah

Gudda!
Each hand a pistol, Gudda Gudda street man official
Sweep with vengence, I rep the land of killers

But we only go to war about family issues
So when we hit you, 
Man they twist you, damb near flip you
And I ain't playing if my hands are sizzling
All I'm saying is Gudda man rise to the motherfuckin bridge is over
The bridge is over, yeah
Gotta keep my head to the clouds 
And the heater putting broozes on my hip
I wish a nigga would trip 
You can find me in the club, pocket full of blunts
To the HIV, 
And I'm into getting head, I ain't tryna love and fuck
 help me get stuck
You can find me on the block, fist full of rocks
And with my hand on my Glock, that shit gon pop
And I don't stop, till your man on top
 laying on top, yeah

Kidd!
I hit the club, where the bitches at?
You know when I come through, the thug niggas 
 slugs 
Where your clicque at, motherfucker
You are what you eat, straight pussy
So I don't pay attention to the shit you say to me
I'm in my zone till I'm 
Ain't a nigga in my clique 
And we don't ball 
We know how to survive off comisary
And I'm one of a kind man, not your normal artist 
Me and my squad tight like Tom and Jerry
On the set where we get wetter than leaks
We get a new freak and hit her for free
Every show smoke og
And I ain't gon fuck them if Embed
