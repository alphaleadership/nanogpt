13 ContributorsHasta La Vista (Demo) Lyrics
Yeah
I like this vibe
Smoking the good marijuana, man
Sipping the good codeine
What a time

Making money bags out of pillowcases
Making money bags on a daily basis
Tattoos on our baby faces, you can't faze to face us
We was raised by Jason, Norman Bates, and Satan, Hellraiser
Stunt like Jason Statham, the J's awaiting, that's my crazy patients
I got what they craving, they place the payment just to taste their favorite
Now I got 'em raving about my latest, you should check the ratings
Separate destinations for the extras making extra paper
Never giving statements to the agents during interrogation
Well aware with proper preparation skipping devastation
Devil never sleep, no sedation until heaven make us
Dreaming 'bout being in better places until hell awake us
We well aware of jealous haters with their allegations
Don't need them to validate us, need their gals to date us
Need their girls to serenade us with their salivators
But we lit like Talladega, Tunechi Schwarzenegger gone

Hasta la vista, baby
Gone, hasta la vista baby
But I'll be back, baby
Yeah I'll be back, baby
Tunechi Schwarzenegger gone
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
But I'll be back, baby
Yeah I'll be back, baby
Gone, Tunechi Schwarzenegger

Oh look, my phone is blowing up
That's your bitch asking to come over, she shall overcome
Oh look my homies showing up, your homies know what's up
It's gon' take some cojones, hope and luck to cope with us, look
We hung right by that corner store with pumps, a lot of dope and bucks
And opened up that box Pandora shut like, keep it closed for what
We keep our noses up to smell the beef
Smell like a rose to us
And all roses must die slow as fuck, we speed it up
We slow it up because we pour it up, you know we pour it up
Trying to coexist with older thugs got us growing up
Knowing much but never know enough, now we loading up
Secret code of trust, keep us holding up and bold and tough
Chin high, eyes forward, shoulders up, protocol, overall
Fight like there’s no tomorrow, soldier (Soulja) boys, you!
Boy you just fuel to all of my fools
I give you little dudes the slaughterhouse rules
Pardon my drool but yall look like food
All that I do is charter my moves
Sparkle my jewels, harbor my goons
I'm hard on my boos cause all they wanna do is come to my room and walk on my moon
All these lil dudes wanna walk in my shoes
And argue about news that’s all about Tune
When all that I do is whatever I choose
And never let you alter my mood, gone
Hasta la vista, baby
Gone, hasta la vista baby
But I'll be back, baby
Yeah I'll be back, baby
Tunechi Schwarzenegger (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
I'll be back, baby (I'm gone)
I'll be back, baby (I'm gone)
Gone, Tunechi Schwarzenegger

Hasta la vista, baby
Product of Cita, baby
High as Khalifa baby
I'm on the Keisha baby
Set it off like Latifa, baby
This lean is my anesthesia, baby
Tell the cops I got amnesia, baby

Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
But I'll be back, baby
I'll be back, baby
I'll be back, baby
Tunechi Schwarzenegger
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
I'll be back, baby
I'll be back, baby
I'll be back, hasta la vista
I'll be back, arrivederci
Gone

Young Mula baby
Young Mula baby
Arrivederci
Hasta la vista, arrivederci
