I might be a young girl, but I know how to have fun
I got them boys chasing me, tryna make me the one
When I'm out shopping, it's like I'm having a gun
Whatever I wanna get, got them boys caught up

I know I'm a hot, hot shawty
But you gotta slow down, you don't know me (Slow down, don't know me)
If you in a hot, hot hurry
Then you gotta go now, back up off me (Go now, off me)

(Uh, oh) Got them going crazy, you see
(Uh, oh) Head over heels for me, oh
(Uh, oh) Weak in the knees for me, boy
(Uh, oh) 'Cause you are so damn easy (Damn easy)

'Cause you are so damn easy (Easy, oh-oh)
'Cause you are so damn easy (Yeah, yeah, oh)
You might also like
I'm much wiser than you think, better act like you know (You know)
Just because I'm a teen, it don't mean that I'm slow
I think you're a cutie, boy, but you're turning me off
Sometimes, you gotta play hard to get and then it's on

I know I'm a hot, hot shawty
But you gotta slow down, you don't know me
If you in a hot, hot hurry
Then you gotta go now, back up off me

(Uh, oh) Got them going crazy, you see
(Uh, oh) Head over heels for me, oh
(Uh, oh) Weak in the knees for me, boy
(Uh, oh) 'Cause you are so damn easy

'Cause you are so damn easy (Easy, yeah, yeah)
'Cause you are so damn easy, oh (One take, Weezy)

Baby, tonight's the night
And them girls all on me like white on rice
And I get 'em to the crib, play two on one
I'm already hot, now it's you on one
Take a jet into the sunset, you wan' come
Or sit in my Phantom and chew on gum
Baby, I can take you to and from
Ice up ya little wrist till ya blue hand numb
Uhm, you dealin' with a boss, lil' mama
Young Wayne, Tony Montana
And for you, I'll tell my homies I'll holla
And if ya man ain't me, why bother?
I go by the name Carter
I got more plaques than tartar
I'm just checking out the charts on the charter
Number one spot, Wayne and Paula
(Uh, oh) Got them going crazy, you see
(Uh, oh) Head over heels for me, oh
(Uh, oh) Weak in the knees for me, boy
(Uh, oh) 'Cause you are so damn easy
(Uh, oh) Got them going crazy, you see
(Uh, oh) Head over heels for me, oh
(Uh, oh) Weak in the knees for me, boy
(Uh, oh) 'Cause you are so damn easy (No, no, no, no, no)

Don't be so damn easy
Don't be so damn easyEmbed
