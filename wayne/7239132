15 ContributorsBuzzinâ€™ Lyrics
(Got it on Smash)
Trust fund baby
Trust fund

Mmhmm, I'm that nigga, slime that nigga
Five that nigga, five that nigga
Find that nigga dead
On his head I left a shiny nickel
Shiny blicka, counterfeit
Tiny trigger, trigger finger, ain't even itchin'
Kind of tickle, I'm a sicko

Honolulu with my new new, rockin' MuMu like it's FuBu
Red everything but Bluetooth
On your grave I do the juju, mhm
Look at my chain, it's bussin', hm
Drip on Usain, it's runnin', hm
She give me brain that's skully, hm
She drunk a Wayne McFlurry, hm
Mmm and I'm on a Xan buzzin', I'ma machine gun 'em
That money machine runnin'
Them niggas know we ain't runnin'
That washin' machine money
I'm talkin' 'bout clean money, I'm talkin' 'bout me and money
All of my bees buzzin', zero degrees buzzin'
What did that mean?
Buzzin' that mean that this shit is a breeze for me
I be on them trees feelin' like the mothafuckin' chimpanzees buzzin'
It's zero degrees and I might squeeze if you sneeze buzzin'
You might also like
Pass me the cup, buzzin'
I need the lean buzzin'
She fucked the whole team buzzin'
The choppa got beam buzzin'
I do not bang nothin'
My bro got the bitches comin'
That's the bro, yeah that's the buzzer
Like a bee, I'm really buzzin'

That ain't my bitch, I let her fucked the Brozallini (Brozallini)
I went to Elian, I bought a ring of VVs
Buzzin' be trappin', rappin'
On the block, but the boys stay cappin'
Netflix how that boy keep actin'
Buzzin' with me and you know he bustin'
Yeah, we buzzin', I'm with my buzzer
They like where you get your chain? That shit bussin'
Yeah, don't worry 'bout that splash, splash
Hundred racks, that's lil' boy cash
Two hundred on the big boy dash
Heard buzzer trippin', he don't get no pass, mhmm
Money on me now like, mhmm
Bet she want a bag, mhmm
Rollie bustin' and the buzzer got one too
Buzzin' got the magic coupe
Pass me the cup, buzzin'
I need the lean buzzin'
She fucked the whole team buzzin'
The choppa got beam buzzin'
I do not bang nothing
My bro got the bitches comin'
That's the bro, yeah that's the buzzer
Like a bee, I'm really buzzin'

Okay, I'm really Bloodin'
Go down with the blicky, fuck it
I rather get caught with somethin'
I can't be Ricky runnin'
On the opps we huntin'
Y'all never score y'all puntin'
I like my hoes disgustin'
On my way, your bitch I'm comin' (Take that, take that, take that)
You like savin' hoes, you a hoarder
We cross out the opps, we be crossin' boarders
SuWoop Gang, I be sendin' orders
SuWoop Gang, red rags on my daughter

Pass me the cup, buzzin'
I need the lean buzzin'
She fucked the whole team buzzin'
The choppa got beam buzzin'
I do not bang nothin'
My bro got the bitches comin'
That's the bro, yeah that's the buzzer
Like a bee, I'm really buzzin'
Mmhmm, I'm that nigga, slime that nigga
Five that nigga, five that nigga
Find that nigga dead
On his head I left a shiny nickel
Shiny blicka, counterfeit
Tiny trigger, trigger finger, ain't even itchin'
Kind of tickle, I'm a sicko

MmhmmEmbed
