Girl just close your eyes and picture me playin your Spanish guitar
Baby where we goin, there are no such thing as a bad note (bad note)
If I could I would, stroke your body like I do my keyboard (keyboard)
Are you ready? Ready to do something you never did before

Let's make love in the (studio) studio (studio) studio (studio)

I see you from the booth
And you remind me of a brand new saxophone (saxophone)
Girl I'm tryin my best, but the music won't let me leave you alone
And your bohhh-dy is like a flute, I can't stop blowin on you
Are you ready? Ready to do something you never did before

Weezy Baby
Now I'm the type of nigga that be up in the studio faithfully
She ain't tripping, she wait for me
I tell her, when I get a break, I'ma break her off so courageously
I got them banging drums, she got them Alicia keys
Ooh girl let's make a beat, ooh, girl, you make me weak
Like every time the track break
Make the control room boom like a 808
And if you walk your thong into this vocal booth
I can guarantee I'ma make this song all about you
And you know I got that drank, you know I got that stank
It's amazing how I think, and I do, so
And every time I meet a girl, she tell me that she sing
And I say I got a house with a studio
I'm just tryna do my thing, baby, video or audio
Shawty, I'm so smooth, I go everywhere that water go
Ooh, so bad, so mean
Make me wrap your ass up like a hot sixteen
And I promise you ain't wanna hear nobody else flow
Welcome to my studio, you gon' love my studio
Do you mind if I pluck upon your string for one minute?
And do you mind if I do some nasty things for one minute?
Girl If I could I would, I would stroke your body like I do my keyboard
Are your ready? Ready to do something you never did before

Let's make love in the (studio) studio (studio) studio (studio)
Let's make love in the (studio) studio (studio) studio (studio)
Let's make love in the (studio) studio (studio) studio (studio)
