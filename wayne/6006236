4 ContributorsLive Forever Lyrics
Ah
Hit-Boy

I do this for suffering children
And checks from goverment buildings
A dope boy who made a check from other than Dilla
What a good feeling when they know you one in a million
The feds burry half of my niggas under the building
Don't judge my life, now nigga 'cause I've been mad stressed
On tour with the locks, and had a project adress
Before this rap shit all my direct assets
Came from high risk hazards you know pyrex glasses?
Along way to the prezi from the time next classic
I got lines from a year, go to charge just catch it
I thought smaller than a group got to find out it was true
Money change to people, around quicker than to change you
You know what B.I.G. said? I'm good long as the kids fed
How niggas stole dirt on your name and then beg?
Nah we don't feel sorry for niggas get ready
'Cause for them California kings we slept in the twenty bag

What's king to a God nigga? I'm gon' live forever
Feed on the grind a hundred in the ceiling (One in the ceiling)
I'm the last to this breed, you won't last any streets long
If you only hustle drug dealing (Drug dealing)
What's a king to a God nigga? I'm gon' live forever, (Live forever)
Nigga I'm gon' live forever, (Live forever)
This for hoes fuckin' rich niggas, you get a Roley too
'Cause if I'm up bitch we gon' shine together
You might also like
I do this for my young, more precious than the Moon is to the Sun
I got more weapons than I'll ever need I shoot you with each one
Talking cocaine out of Medellin, my hoe straight out the magazine
You drowning in the fire, while I'm snorkeling in a gasoline
Steady diet of heavy drugs, rolling kush up like
Pirelli tires on Chevy trucks, but still a Goodyear
They got every eye on each one of us
Well nigga, look here
I'll come catch your ass on career day and end your career
I got pistols I just cleaned, I been tryna get dirty with you
I got niggas on my team that ain't tryna swap jerseys with you
I pop it, that thirty hit you, them shots from the thirty whistle
Watchin' movies with a bitch that wouldn't watch a commercial with you
I'm higher than everyone, but almighty, I treat the white girl like a wifey
Treat her like Aphrodite, let a goddess satisfy me
While I'm rollin' the tighty, I chop the hands off a clock
That mean I'm timeless, don't time me, I'm forever

What's king to a God nigga? I'm gon' live forever
Feed on the grind a hundred in the ceiling (One in the ceiling)
I'm the last to this breed, you won't last any streets long
If you only hustle drug dealing (Drug dealing)
What's a king to a God nigga? I'm gon' live forever, (Live forever)
Nigga I'm gon' live forever, (Live forever)
This for hoes who fuckin' rich niggas, you get a Roley too
'Cause if I'm up bitch we gon' shine together1Embed
