No Ceilings
Mannie Fresh on the beat
Fuck them foes up

Tell my bitches it’s show time, tell my niggas it’s go time
Sipping lean, I’m on a slow time, choking off the weed like it’s a bowtie
Shoot your ass up in no time, and all my shooters gon’ cosign
And all you haters get paid no mind, money talks, I told it speak your mind
All my niggas for-lifers, and all my bitches one-nighters
And all my hoes curvaceous, and all their clothes are enticing
None of my bitches got prices, none of my niggas got licenses
I’m on my 56 Nights shit, I fuck with that Future like psychics
I’m in the suite eating snow crab, I’m in the street like the dope man
We do drive-bys in Mopeds, smoke strong like Popeye, Conan
I beat the pussy up, I just throat jab, I got her legs in the air, that’s a toe grab
I make the bitch call me Macho Man, I’m sipping on lean bumping Slow Jamz, hey
Tell my niggas it’s show time, tell my niggas it’s show time
Sipping lean, I’m on a slow time, choking off the weed like it’s a bowtie
Lights, camera, action, got a nice tasty fashion
Got some nice tasting bitches, and I like tasting bitches
And I like taking money, I don’t like taking pictures
But I like naked pictures, I saw your wife’s naked pictures
I saw your homies with the cops, and I don’t like snakes and snitches
You know it’s lonely at the top, it’s just me, kites, planes, and pigeons (hi neighbor)
It’s just me, life, rags, and riches, I didn’t have a pot or pan to piss in
Now I’m like Ice Man, I’m chilling, laying on white sand, she sniffing
Laying on satin sheets, I’m comfy, I came from the backstreets, that’s bumpy
Now I’m like Wall Street with money, and bitch don’t call me for nothing with your broke ass
Tell my niggas it’s show time, tell my bitches it’s show time
Sipping lean, I’m on a slow time, choking off the weed like it’s a bowtie
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action
My bitch like the camera action, just like Pamela Anderson, ohh
I tell my bitches it’s show time, I tell my niggas it’s show time
And all my niggas gon’ throw signs, we gangbanging nigga, fuck your side
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action
I’m the main attraction, my bitch sexy and attractive
My bitch sexy and attractive, fancy, flexible, elastic
We have sex while we in traffic, we have sex then re-enact it
She take X and she do acid, she took X amount of classes
My bitch classy and she ratchet, sassy and nasty, and romantic
My bitch sexy and attractive, she'll collect the 
And she healthy and she sweet, I eat it like vegetables and candy
My bitch sexy and she crafty, my bitch sexy wearing glasses
My bitch sexy wearing khakis, my bitch never wearing panties, no
Tell my bitches it’s show time, tell my niggas it’s show time
Tell them niggas we lit, lit like the Apollo sign
Getting money and getting so high, Versace shades, that’s 4 eyes
She suck the dick till her throat tired, I fuck the bitch till we both tired
My bitch look like Kiki Shepard, your bitch look like a German Shepard
Got 2 hoes with me, salt and pepper, and you can’t have salt without pepper
Took them to my spot like a leopard, I fucked them soon as they stepped in
Your niggas ain’t goons, they yes men, these niggas ain’t Tune, I’m special, lord
I told my niggas it’s show time, and we ain’t finished, we need more time
I just want some ass and a blowjob, my bitch want an ass and a nose job
I spent some bands on a bowtie, I give her bands, tell her “go shopping”
I need my check from my old job, I need my check from my old job
Watch out lil bitch or get clotheslined, I say “take off your clothes,” she say “sure, fine”
They say my mind is a goldmine, I say “no shit,” I say “no lie”
I’m on my shit, in control slime, I’m on my shit, I control mine
I told my bitches it’s show time, I told my niggas it’s show time
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action
I’m the main attraction, my bitch sexy and attractive
My bitch sexy and attractive, my bitch sexy and attractive
She say I’m sexy and I’m handsome, I got a Jet Ski and a Phantom
I got a condo and a mansion, I got a main hoe and companion
I got a plain hoe and a dancer, I got a lame hoe and a fast one
Imma finesse and pull a fast one, I got connects from here to NASA
Got a direct line on Jigga, but I don’t text or harass him
But when I do holler at him, it ain’t never about you rappers
Cuz y’all just rap about shit you never did and shit that’s never about to happen
And I’m so tired of these lil dudes, excuse me if I start napping
And then my 3 wishes was granted and that was lights, camera, action, I’m gone

Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action
