1 ContributorI’m the One LyricsYou’re lookin’ at the truth, the money never lie, no
I’m the one, yeah, I’m the one
Early mornin’ in the dawn, you know you wanna ride now
I’m the one, yeah
I’m the one, yeah
Hear, you’re sick of all those other imitators
Don’t let the only real one intimidate you
See you watchin’, don’t run outta time now
I’m the one, yeah, oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh
I’m the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh
I’m the one, yeah, oh-еh-oh oh-eh-oh
I’m the one oh-еh-oh oh-eh-oh
I’m the only one
I’m the one that hit that same spot
She the one that bring the raindrops
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch
You the one that hold me down when the block’s hot
I make your dreams come true when you wake up
And your look’s just the same without no makeup
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you’re made of
Ain’t gotta worry ‘bout ‘em commas ‘cause my cake up
You can run inside my life from that fame bus
‘Cause I promise when we step out you’ll be famous
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us
‘Cause when they pull up-prr prr-all angles
You’re lookin’ at the truth, the money never lie, no
I’m the one, yeah, I’m the one
Early mornin’ in the dawn, know you wanna ride now
I’m the one, yeah
I’m the one, yeah
Hear you’re sick of all those other imitators
Don’t let the only real one intimidate you
See you watchin’, don’t run outta time now
I’m the one, yeah, oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh
I’m the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh
I’m the one, yeah, oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh
I’m the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh
I’m the only one
You’re lookin’ at the truth, the money never lie, no
I’m the one, yeah, I’m the one
Early mornin’ in the dawn, you know you wanna ride now
I’m the one, yeah
I’m the one, yeah
Hear, you’re sick of all those other imitators
Don’t let the only real one intimidate you
See you watchin’, don’t run outta time now
I’m the one, yeah, oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh
I’m the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh
I’m the one, yeah, oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh
I’m the one oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh
I’m the only one
Don’t you know boy, don’t you know boy
I am the one for you (I am the one for you)
Don’t you know boy, don’t you know boy
I am the one for you (Don’t you know I’m the one)You might also likeEmbed
