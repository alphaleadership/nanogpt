4 ContributorsNo Ceilings (Demo) Lyrics
I ain’t playin’ with niggas
We them niggas
Roar like gorillas
We the realest
We roll with the hitters
We came from the city it killed us
We the littest
Like Wayne I got no ceilings
Where is the ceilings?
I see no ceilings
We got no feelings
We enough to got no feelings
My brothers that’s in the game
We in this shit
Niggas go out in a blaze, making hard done decisions

Livin’ through tension
Friends get distance
Diamonds don’t glisten
They don’t wanna mention you
Video instant views
Bitches wanna pick and choose
Diamond like a Biggie Glue
My nigga we runnin’ for days, no we got the vision
Livin’ like that’s in a lane, hope we don’t collision
We ain’t built to lose
She looking at my fin tattoo
She become an instant boo
You might also like
I ain’t playin’ with niggas
We them niggas
Roar like gorillas
We the realest
We roll with the hitters
We came from the city it killed us
We the littest
Like Wayne I got no ceilings
Where is the ceilings?
I see no ceilings
We got no feelings
We enough to got no feelings
My brothers that’s in the game
We in this shit
Niggas go out in a blaze, making hard done decisions

Where is the ceilings? (where is the ceilings)
I got no feelings (no, no, no)
Oh, oh, oh, haven’t felt love in a minute (no, I didn’t)
And I want the squad coming strong (let’s go)
Real drip V low on
Put that bitch in a Maybach, told her lay back
And throw some A$AP on (yeah)
I put my faith in to God, the pussy ain’t right if you don’t get me hard
Do what I say or I’mma depart
Bitch, I will replace you with Nicki Minaj
And I got this big bank on me
I ain’t dealin’ with vibes if it’s corny
Boy you better not run up, you’ll get done up
Never do slipping, I’ll be all clean
I ain’t playin’ with niggas
We them niggas
Roar like gorillas
We the realest
We roll with the hitters
We came from the city it killed us
We the littest
Like Wayne I got no ceilings
Where is the ceilings?
I see no ceilings
We got no feelings
We enough to got no feelings
My brothers that’s in the game
We in this shit
Niggas go out in a blaze, making hard done decisions

I got no ceilings, I never had ’em nigga
Pop me a handle bar then I handle business
I’m on that Actavis, call it Activism
I like my chinchillas soft as caterpillars
I got no issues, but I got ammunition ‘case I got issues
Chop a kilo down like paper and scissor
China white bitch, I’m breaking the dishes
Hands down bitch, I’m too out of hand
Hands up, I kill you with my hands
Masked up like I flew from Japan
Bap bap! That’s for you and your man
No cap-cap, I don’t do it with words
Flap flap, that’s my wings you just heard
Yeah, kidnap anything for them birds
No trap rap, I’m way in the suburbs
Rolls Royce, stars came on the roof
But I removed the roof and we can see the stars, bitch
I got dogs on the loose
Now you can call a truce, but I can’t call ’em off bitch
I got dogs that don’t roof
Got bitches fallin’ through and niggas fallin’ off, shit
I ain’t got no fuckin’ feelings
Got you catchin’ fuckin’ feelings
Fuck your feelings, bitch
We them niggas (we them niggas)
Roar like gorillas (we roar like gorillas)
We the realest (and we the realest)
We roll with the hitters (hitters)
We came from the city it killed us (a city it kill us)
We the littest (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Like Wayne I got no ceilings (I have no ceilings)
Where is the ceilings? (now where is the ceilings)
I see no ceilings (I see no ceilings)
We got no feelings (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We enough to got no feelings
My brothers that’s in the game (yeah)
We in this shit (yeah)
