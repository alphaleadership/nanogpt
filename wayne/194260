4 ContributorsHow To Love (Live) Lyrics
Cut the music up, little louder, yeah

See, I had a lot of crooks tryna steal my heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love, how to love
See, I had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now I'm in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love

For a second you were here
Now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had my love
How to love

When I was just a young and my looks were so precious
But now I'm grown up
So fly, it's like a blessing, but I can't have a man look at me for five seconds
Without me feeling insecure
You never credit yourself, so when I got older
It's seems like I came back ten times over
Now, I'm sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all my thoughts and looking over my shoulder
You might also like
See, I had a lot of crooks try to steal my heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love, how to love
See, I had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now I'm in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love

Oh, I had a lot of dreams that transformed to visions
In fact then I saw the world effecting all my decisions
But it wasn't my fault
Wasn't in my intentions
To be the one there talking
Be the one there listening
See I don't mind your popping bottles and dipping
Just as much as you admire bar-tending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks but the crooks still crook

See, I had a lot of crooks try to steal my heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love, how to love
See, I just want you to know
See, I deserve the best, I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful, yeah
See, I want you to know
I'm far from the usual
Far from the usual

I had a lot of crooks try to steal my heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love, how to love
I had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now I'm in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
