Fuck (Emergency)
19AKIRA

I've been workin' hard to find my way into a better life
I got sick and tired of making excuses, finding reasons why
I couldn't do it, talkin' down on myself 'cause I felt like
Nobody knew the pain I felt but that's just life
And when you focus, it's so hard to see how fortunate you are
Knowing any given moment you could die and be a star so
I've been on my job workin' hard to earn somethin' worth more than I got, knowing something gotta pop

Like I know I got it, I can do it with a blindfold
Own it, I'ma do it 'til my eyes close
Regardless what they sayin', knowin' I'ma find my way in
I'm knowin' like I know, I got it, I can do it with a blindfold
Own it, I'ma do it 'til my eyes close
Regardless what they sayin', knowin' I'ma find my way in (Yeah)

And I've been tryin' to find my way
I've been tryin' to pave my lane
Strugglin' with sanity, the enemy of my mind's still hate
But I can never let that change my pace
Feelin' like I'm at war every day and I'm a soldier
Feelin' like I want more and I can get it if I focus
Wouldn't leave the past where it's at and put my best foot forward
If I work, I know I earn what I'm supposed to

Like I know I got it, I can do it with a blindfold
Own it, I'ma do it 'til my eyes close
Regardless what they sayin', knowin' I'ma find my way in
I'm knowin' like I know, I got it, I can do it with a blindfold
Own it, I'ma do it 'til my eyes close
Regardless what they sayin', knowin' I'ma find my way in (Yeah)Embed
