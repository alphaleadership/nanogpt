15 ContributorsResent Lyrics
(What Juicy say? He be like, "Shut the fuck up")
You know it

I resent
Every second, every minute that I spent (Hmm, hmm)
Every comment or response I never sent (Yeah)
Whatever had you thinkin' we were ever friends? (Tell 'em, man)
I admit I should've been done trusted then, now I resent
Every penny, every dollar I just spent (Hey)
Showin' love for me it wasn't genuine (Hey)
It's so crazy how you hated on me then (Hey)
I know you gon' really hate me when I, when I, when I, when I (Let's go)

When I pull up on my ex-bitch
You my next bitch
Like, yes, bitch (Damn)
Don't make my bitch have to check a bitch
This ain't checkers, bitch
This chess, bitch (Damn)
Pull up with my new vibe, you throwback, Mitchell Ness, bitch (Damn)
Told bae, "That bitch I had before you was just a reference" (Damn)
That's facts, facts, I'm past that and I don't backtrack
I see you pullin' up with his wack ass
Get laughed at like Jackass
I'ma do me much better than I used to do you
I'm a new me, much better if I never knew you
Like, "Who you?" Bitch, you-hoo
I'm a free man, on the beach, man
All I brung is me to the beach sand
With a beach babe up in each hand
You throw shade, still we tan
You mad, ooh, you hatin'
No shampoo, you flakin'
Had to flip the script, one-eighty
Had to leave the bitch, Tom Brady
Mula, baby

Every second (Yeah), every minute that I spent (I spent)
Every comment or response I never sent (Woah, woah)
It's so crazy how you hated on me then
I know you gon' really hate me when I, when I, when I, when I
(Let's go)

Pull up in that big body Benz with dark tints
But I ain't hidin' when I roll up, you gon' know who I am
Your love was fake, it wasn't ever real
When you get around somethin' off

I get the feelin' that you might be tryna knife me
When you actin' so politely, you really spite me
'Cause you see me livin' nicely, really pricey
Drivin' somethin' so depressin', suicidin'
Somebody call the paramedics, you lookin' sickly
'Cause I'm leavin' you on read when you try to hit me
When you thought that I was down, you was tryna kick me
I was busy movin' past you, that's why you miss me

Now you know why I resent
Every second, every minute that I spent
Every comment or response I never sent
It's so crazy how you hated on me then
I know you gon' really hate me when I, when I, when I, when I
Win, 'cause you used to losin'
Now you feelin' more resentment, I been where you been
After that it's gon' be vengeance
Where I am now
Keep your energy from 'round me
Stay the fuck from 'round me

Just in case you might be tryna knife me
When you actin' so politely, you really spite me
'Cause you see me livin' nicely, really pricey
Drivin' somethin' so depressin', suiciding
Somebody call the paramedics, you lookin' sickly (Oh, oh-oh)
'Cause I'm leavin' you on read when you try to hit me
When you thought that I was down, you was tryna kick me
I was busy movin' past you, that's why you miss me

Now you know why I resent
Every second, every minute that I spent
Every comment or response I never sent
Whatever had you thinkin' we were ever friends?
I admit I should've been done trusted then, now I resent
Now I resent (I resent)
Every penny, every dollar I ever spent (Show, oh-oh)
Showin' love for me, it wasn't genuine (Wasn't genuine)
It's so crazy how you hated on me then (Your boy, Juicy J)
I know you gon' really hate me when I, when I, when I, when I (I got you, man, shut the fuck up)
I think I'm too content (Damn)
Niggas can't even pay the rent
What I just spent won't leave a dent (Damn)
What's in your wallet? Lint (Damn)
Bitch, I just hopped out a Bent'
I smell like money, you know the scent (Damn)
If you gave me head, repent
I'm hard on a bitch, cement
They pay me your salary for an event
It ain't no mileage, no, this whip I'm in
Stay away from 'round me, I know you ain't ten
Can't pick a side, you on the fence
You niggas on the bench
My money long, trench
Have what I want, I'm rich
You out here runnin' your mouth like a bitch
Can't trust niggas, I'm like Mitch
They want my life, they want my bitch
You ain't a hundred with this shit
You like sixty-nine percent
You wanna talk, they wanna vent
I wanna get every cent
Bitch, I been on for a minute
They been hatin' on me ever since (You know)

I resent (Facts)4Embed
