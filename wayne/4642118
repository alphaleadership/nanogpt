9 ContributorsIn A Cage Lyrics(Jojee)
Medicate me like a mental case
Cuz I'm an animal in a cage
In my bed we'll take the stage
Cuz we're just animals in a cage
(Lil Wayne)
You hear rarara
You hear ooolala
Just animals in a cage
I got the zoo on lock
We bout to tear this bitch down
I pull this elephant out
You lookin edible now
Like you ain't been pet in awhile
And if we get out there baby we sleep to the jungle
You know im still linked to the jungle
You know im the king of the jungle
I pull the strings you strung to
I flap the wings you run to
I teach you things you dumb to
Imma be an animal wit you
That other guy he's gon hunt you
You know Im discreet he disgustin
You know he just beat it and brush it
You know im elite he eruptive
And you know im a freak he gon judge you
And you know imma treat it so custom
And you know like a beak he gon duck you
When you under my wing its so different
And you know in that cage i go Nicholas
You might also like(Jojee)
Medicate me like a mental case
Cuz I'm an animal in a cage
In my bed we'll take the stage
Cuz we're just animals in a cage
(Lil Wayne)
Let me be your animal
And let me geranimo geranimo all up in your cameltoe
Girl i got the antidote
Let me medicate you and get vetenarial
Imma eat you like a lion eat an antelope on an animal planet show
Shes on to me now
We born to be wild
She sworn that she vow imma only denial?
Catch her on the rebound
Animalistic sexual tendencies express them tremendously
And work out the chemistry enjoy the intensity, serenity
We bout that wild life
We bout that high life
We get higher than eyesight
And then we just skydive
Mentality in a phase radicals in a rage
Valuables in a blaze hot animals in a cage
(Jojee)
Medicate me like a mental case
Cuz I'm an animal in a cage
In my bed we'll take the stage
Cuz we're just animals in a cage
(Lil Wayne)
You know you know you know
Under my wing its so different
You know in that cage I go Nicholas
Up in that cage I go Johnny
And I pull this elephant out
She lookin edible now
Like she ain't been pet in awhile
Yeah I pull this elephant out
She put on a sexier smile
Like she ain't been fed in awhile
Animals in a cage
Cameras in a cage
Dont be naked and afraid we some animals in a cage girl
Got candles lit in the cage girl
And we lit in the cage girl
(Jojee)
Medicate me like a mental case
Cuz I'm an animal in a cage
In my bed we'll take the stage
Cuz we're just animals in a cage

Animals in a cage
Cameras in a cage
Dont be naked and afraid we some animals in a cage girl
Got candles lit in the cage girl
And we lit in the cage girl
