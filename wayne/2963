14 ContributorsGimme Whatcha Got Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen (Ayy)
You are now tuned in to the very best (Oh, the very best)
So beautiful (So beautiful), one, two, three, oh
Jazzy Phizzle, Chris Brown, let's go

They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Well, I bet I couldn't look more bolder
Hold her as we dip into my solar
Call me Ford, baby, I explore her
This navigator, you the one like Lincoln
Black Bentley, you look better in a pink one
She smoking and I'm about to steam one
Let's skip and make love on Venus
Baby, the ball's in your court like Sere-nus
Make me jump over that net between us
And let nothing get between us
We too hot, only sweat between us

Girl, you're hot like fire, gimme whatcha got
Coldest thing moving, gimme whatcha got
Heat up like summer, gimme whatcha got
Girl, you know what you're doing, gimme whatcha got
You like 28's on the Hummer, gimme whatcha got
'Cause you the number one stunner, gimme whatcha got
You got it, gimme whatcha got
You got it, girl
See Chris Brown LiveGet tickets as low as $58,500You might also like
That's it, baby girl, pulling on my zipper
We ain't in the club but I still wanna tip her
You should be my misses, I could be your mister
Put me on deck, shawty, I could be your skipper

I'll give you a kiss for every time you make me smile
I'll give you a thousand if you stay a little while
Longer and it's getting stronger
The feeling that I got for you, shorty, do what it do

Girl, you're hot like fire, gimme whatcha got
Coldest thing moving, gimme whatcha got
Heat up like summer, gimme whatcha got
Girl, you know what you're doing, gimme whatcha got
You like 28's on the Hummer, gimme whatcha got
'Cause you the number one stunner, gimme whatcha got
You got it, gimme whatcha got
You got it, girl

Exit now I got a place where we can go
Back seat action, sunroof for deuce
And the windows tinted so nobody could look in
Put it in gear and burn out with me
I'll give you a kiss for every time you make me smile
I'll give you a thousand if you stay a little while
Longer and it's getting stronger
The feeling that I got for you, shorty, do what it do

Girl, you're hot like fire, gimme whatcha got (Ooh, ooh)
Coldest thing moving, gimme whatcha got (Hey)
Heat up like summer, gimme whatcha got (Heat up)
Girl, you know what you're doing, gimme whatcha got (You like)
You like 28's on the Hummer, gimme whatcha got (Ooh, ooh)
'Cause you the number one stunner, gimme whatcha got (Yeah)
You got it, gimme whatcha got (You got it)
You got it, girl (Haha, woo!)

Girl, you the flyest thing that I've seen and I'm tryna get with you
Girl, girl, you on fire and I know that you're burning hot
Shorty, you're burning hot, I'm talking to you
I'ma set you on fire and all I do is think about you, yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Girl, you're hot like fire, gimme whatcha got
Coldest thing moving, gimme whatcha got
Heat up like summer, gimme whatcha got (I heat up like summer)
Girl, you know what you're doing, gimme whatcha got (You know what you doing)
You like 28's on the Hummer, gimme whatcha got (Hummer)
'Cause you the number one stunner, gimme whatcha got (Stunner)
You got it, gimme whatcha got
You got it, girl
Girl, you're hot like fire, gimme whatcha got
Coldest thing moving, gimme whatcha got
Heat up like summer, gimme whatcha got (I heat up like summer)
Girl, you know what you're doing, gimme whatcha got (You know what you doing)
You like 28's on the Hummer, gimme whatcha got (Hummer)
'Cause you the number one stunner, gimme whatcha got (Stunner)
