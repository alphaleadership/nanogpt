It's Sean and Weezy, Weezy 
Let's ride (ya mon!) and get high (Kingston!)
Let's ride, and get high
We don't back down, I'm laying the smack down
I'm sorry but you're never gonna see me fall
We don't back down, we movin' in packs now
I'm sorry but you niggas don't scare me at all
We don't back down, we makin' them stacks now
I'm sorry but we're just gonna continue to ball
We don't back down, I'm stating the facts now
But you niggas never gonna see us fall

Chea!
Young and famous
Still armed and dangerous
Real nigga, take my own charge like LaDainian
Wild like a, Tasmanian devil, metal your cranium
I got my guap in a headlock; wrestlemania
Ha! man, I do what I do, look at all the bullshit I been through
Some call beef with you know who - but I turn that to beef stew
Rapper eater eat you, and if we stop the beat
You can probably still hear me picking rappers from my teeth
I’m the last of the elite
I got money, fuck a friend
Got them goons on deck like pitchers in the bullpen
On them Lil Weezy Ana streets, nigga fuck where you been
On a scale of 1 to 10, shawty I’m a 10

Let's ride, and get high 
We don't back down, I'm laying the smack down
I'm sorry but you're never gonna see me fall
We don't back down, we movin' in packs now
I'm sorry but you niggas don't scare me at all
We don't back down, we makin' them stacks now
I'm sorry but we're just gonna continue to ball
We don't back down, I'm stating the facts now
But you niggas never gonna see us fall
Let's ride, and get high 

Armed and dangerous
Ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious
Thug-ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like nigga move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo game, talk yo shit
Grab yo gat, call yo clique
Squeeze yo clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you gonna do: fight or run?
It's Sean and Weezy, Weezy 2Embed
