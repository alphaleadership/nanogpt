10 ContributorsJungle LyricsWelcome to the jungle, where the hungry eat the humble
And the money don't talk - it mumble
Looks like another homicide, call Colombo
That Uzi go "Brrrr" - that's the motherfuckin' drumroll
Gun low in the hoodie, bundle in her pussy
I hope you die with your eyes open, still lookin'
Fuck you lookin' at?
Yo' wig - I push it back
Can stuff a quarter-bird in her if her pussy fat, ya dig
It's young Tunechi, I'm all about the loochie
Superstar still a pop your ass like a bruski
Keep the chopper in the case like an acoustic
Straight barbecue your ass - Ruths Chris
God, hold me down if I run out the bullets
Yeah that Uzi make music - it's time to boogie
Ha-ha, die slow hoe-nigga
This the jungle
I don't go hard, I go-rilla
I got 'emYou might also like2Embed
