31 ContributorsMaybach Music VI Lyrics
J.U.S.T.I.C.E League

Oh, glidin' through the city to my place (My place)
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space (And you can still)
Oh, you can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back (Maybach Music)
Oh, ah, Maybach Music (Maybach Music)

Flows mind-blowing, these niggas switching the topic
All dick-riders, your label labeled erotic
You got a couple dollars, but really, it's barely modest
Couldn't sign me if you niggas was payin' homage
Playin' both sides, convicted you with verdict
Pay a lil' rider, come hit you up for the murder
Chains all hollow, I peeped soon as I heard it
These niggas be talkin' shooter, but quick to send they attorney
Is it really real, like Candy Lady allure?
Money overboard, kilos washin' ashore
Paintings on the wall, Versace down to the drawers
Currency come in Crypto, you know they tapin' our calls
Chariots and lofts, niggas legs crossed
Talkin' long money, but they conversation's short
New accolades with women for me to toss
They call it "the road to riches", regardless, I had to walk
Now it's too many cars, they say I live in a bubble
But I make it the point, we poppin' all through the Summer
Got pilots and gunners, receivers, passers and punters
My pockets playin' for keeps, G's get more than what's common
I made a few mistakes, I pray I get to repent
The passion came from the pain, I'm paintin' you all my sins
Warhol, Art Basel how it's so soft
More raw 'til Hov cut the 'fro off
See Rick Ross LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like
Glidin' through the city to my place (My place)
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space (And you can still)
Oh, you can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back (Maybach Music)
Oh, ah, Maybach Music

Let's go for a ride to where your heart desire
I put your heart in drive, I'll let you borrow mine
My feet on top the clouds, I walk a thousand miles
She got them soft pussy lips, call it cotton mouth
And I'm on autopilot, got a larger closet
I'm at target practice, you at Target shoppin'
Second hand smoke got her vision partly cloudy
Her eyes get so watery, them bitches started drownin'
On the ride of a lifetime
Watch out for the rats, mice, cons and the pythons
No Triple H, my God, I'm so sky high
Comin' down from the night sky, like a lightening rod
Shine like some ice, nice vibes, like a kite flyin'
No strings attached, we replace it with a lifeline
Out of body feelin', out our clothes and our right minds
Baby, ride me like a bumpy road to the high rise, yeah, yeah

Glidin' through the city to my place (My place)
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space (And you can still)
Oh, you can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back (Maybach Music)
Oh, ah, Maybach Music
Glidin' through the city to my place (My place)
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space (And you can still)
