11 ContributorsRun (Remix) Lyrics
Psst
Yo (Yo)
Yo, yo (Yo, it's 5-0)
Yo, we gotta run

Ayy, yo, I jumped from the eighth floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Runnin' through them pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summons
So I stopped at the second floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'
My pockets is mean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them DT's had, black, they was rated PG
Run, I will not give up (No)
Quick, flag the car down (Yo, yo, yo)
Take me toâ€” "Ghost, here they come now"
Err, peel off quick
Back up, hit the bitch
Dog, turn down Hill, light the Marley spliff (Run)
I will not get bagged on the rock (Run)
I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops (Run)
They amp shit, plant shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home when I'm fifty-six (No)
Die with the heart of Scarface, it take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me in the shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, threw the bird
Hop curb, swerve or get swerved
These cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port, "I don't wanna merge"
You might also like
I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up
Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest
I had to break free
Police on me and they FB's
Yelling, "I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze"
That's when I hit the window, Indo' coming out the back room
Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar
Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me
Cab just missed me
Plus the Gucci frames fell, that's six-fifty
Stop back at suite, then leap the fence, slid through my man garden
Yelled out, "Pardon", kept it moving, peace
Bill be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves
Please, plus they heard I'm getting parmesan cheese
And I won't stop moving 'til the metal dig me
Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me
That's when it is what it is, if it's that or the gun
But in the ill gangsters' book, what them niggas do is

Run, if you sell drugs in the school zone
Run, if you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run, fuck that, run, cops got guns
They givin' out life like by the tons
Run, if you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run, hop fences, jump over benches
When you see me comin', get the fuck out the entrance
Run, fuck that, run, cops got guns
Ah-hah
I might gotta take my shirt off (Yeah, kid)
I liked that one (Uh-huh, go in, go in)
Yeah, uh

It's Task Force Tuesday, the narcs is in the black car (Uh)
I got five hundred hundred-packs in my backyard (Uh-huh)
Clear twelve-twelve that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggas' throats on the sales while they puff L's (Wow)
Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the OG's to save everything (Save everything)
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me (Run)
Besides that, I got about five years on me (Run)
Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me (Run)
My Timbs start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me (Run)
It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the Thruway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm trying to hold my hammer up and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets than jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
Imagine if I would have let off a shot or two
You know what I gotta do
Free hold East Coast whole, Boston to Philly down
Down to Delaware, y'all really toting the milli' 'round
I'll bring the milli' to your house
I was just down South Carolina, had the milli' down there
Myrtle Beach, had the heater in reach and four freaks
Some hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard Freedom of Speech
Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run
But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece
I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate
It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon
But before I left the premise, saw two more bitches
They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom (Okay)
I did (Okay), and then we went zoom
Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness?
I'm buggin', I'm trippin', in reality, I'm skitzin'
The cops got me trapped in the alley with the Smith and (Gang)

Run, if you sell drugs in the school zone
Run, if you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run, fuck that, run, cops got guns
They givin' out life like by the tons
Run, if you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run, hop fences, jump over benches
When you see me comin', get the fuck out the entrance
Run, fuck that, run, cops got guns (Motherfucker)

D-Boy, yeah, yeah
Birdman Junior in your building, people
I'ma let you know how it go down on my side of the mountain, whoadie (Yeah)

Ayy, it's jump out Thursday, you heard me?
And the drought been effective since 9/11
I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two-time felon
That's why I keep the top up on my 911, peelin'
In New Orleans, they got no RICO law
So I keep that heat in the car
But they don't know I got that 'dro in the seat of the car
But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow
Ayy, Ghostface, them youngins on the block duckin' blue and red lights
While your boy bypassing fed life
But if them cock suckers ever get me, dead right
Three hots in the cot, swallow weed and a knife, right?
I speed at night, take it easy in the day
Go hard wit the dope, take it easy wit the yay
Yup, Lil' Weezy, I get my loot up
But if the pull up come, I say, my crew run, run, run

Run, if you sell drugs in the school zone
Run, if you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run, fuck that, run, cops got guns
They givin' out life like by the tons
Run, if you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run, hop fences, jump over benches
When you see me comin', get the fuck out the entrance
Run, fuck that, run, cops got guns
