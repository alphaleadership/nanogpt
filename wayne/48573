Baby, can I come over and play?
Probably you're the type to fuck and never call again
They say I'm crazy
Cause I gotta get a taste
Listen, I'll kiss the gun and love overrun
But you're gonna love it
Let it loose now

You can play in my band, I can teach you guitar
Here's ya backstage pass, let me make you a star
You can play in my band, I can teach you guitar
Here's ya backstage pass, let me make you a star
Let it loose now
Let it loose now
Let it loose now
Let it loose now

Guitar Hero
Tuck ya' bitch in before ya bitch get Deebo'd
Is that ya' girlfriend because I seen her at three shows
And she say I'm a blessing, call me the cathedral
Weezy F. Baby, lyrical kilo
I think she tryna OD though
I throw my guitar off the stage into the mosh pit, bitch
How 'bout I fuck a bitch in a mosh pit? Bitch like
Fucking right I'm tight, I'm a knot slip bitch
And me and my band gon' rock this bitch
You might also like
I'ma fuck her face off, fuck her waist off
The Martian, she hops on my rocket and take off
5, 4, 3, 2, mic check, EQ
She is the groupie and we are the crew
And this is my solo, so take my photo
My #1 fan, Mrs. I'm-With-The-Band, yeah!

You can play in my band, I can teach you guitar
Here's ya backstage pass, let me make you a star
You can play in my band, I can teach you guitar
Here's ya backstage pass, let me make you a star
Let it loose now
Let it loose now
Let it loose now
Let it loose now

Oooh, can you make me sound like the strings you playing?
And oooh, autograph your name in the sheets we lay in
And oooh, boy tonight your show is starring me
So meet me in the back, let's act up
Let it loose, come on, let's sex up!

You can play in my band, I can teach you guitar
Here's ya backstage pass, let me make you a star
You can play in my band, I can teach you guitar
Here's ya backstage pass, let me make you a star
Let it loose now
Let it loose now
Let it loose now
Let it loose now1Embed
