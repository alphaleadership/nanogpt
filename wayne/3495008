8 ContributorsIt Ainâ€™t Me, Babe (Cover) Lyrics
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed (yeah)
I'm not the one you want babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone who's never weak
But always strong
To protect you and defend you whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

But it ain't me babe
No, no, no it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're looking for babe

Now go lightly from the ledge babe
Go lightly on the ground
See I'm not the one you want babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you babe
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more
You might also like
But it ain't me babe
No, no, no it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're looking for babe

You say you're looking for someone to pick you up each
Each time you fall
Each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly and to come
Each time you call
And will love you for your life and nothing more

But it ain't me babe
No, no, no it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're looking for babe
No, no it ain't me
No, no it ain't me babe
No, no, no it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're looking for babe
It ain't me babe
It ain't me you're looking for3Embed
