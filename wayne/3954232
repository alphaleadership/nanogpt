18 ContributorsVelvet Lyrics
My nigga Hood just walked in this bitch
All I know is what she tell me and all she tell me is she love me
(Turn the music up in my headphones please)
Uh

All I know is what she tell me and all she tell me is she love me
Well, call me a dummy, 'cause I believe all that she say
Mama didn't raise me this way, what I don't know won't hurt me
So I just continue to do it, I just continue to do you
'Cause you got that ooh, ooh
Got me in this bitch like ooh, ooh
Teach me some new things, be my Guru

I'm doin' this for the bald hair hoes, long hair hoes
Hoes, hoes, ain't nothin' but hoes
The nappy hair hoes, the good hair hoes
Hoes, hoes, ain't-
I'm doin' this for the natural hair hoes, fake hair hoes
Hoes, hoes, ain't nothin' but hoes
Those hoes ain't nothin but hoes
Nothin' but hoes compared to the woman that I chose

Oh, now all them hoes mad
All them hoes mad, you got all them hoes mad
They see that you got me all in your hands
You should put me down and give them all autographs, that'd be dope
Tonight, a lot goin' down
'Cause I'm goin' down, finna prove my crown
And I won't stop until I hear the ooh, ah sound
Lord, I don't know what I'm doin'
Lord, I don't know what I'm doin'
All she know is what I tell her, all I tell her is I'm her's
Lord, I don't know what I'm doin'
But I mean every word
Yeah, Lord, I don't know what I'm feelin'
But it's a feelin' I deserve, yeah
Now all my hoes mad, all my hoes mad
I got all my hoes mad
They say, "Tune, I'm never callin' your ass"
And I text 'em and say, "You just caught in the past"
And that's, oh
All these hoes mad, all these hoes mad
We got all these hoes mad
They see how we makin' love, it's so grand
A celebrity couple, they all know they fans of us both
And we turn up, never turn down
I pull her skirt down, first round, ooh
She a beast when her hair down
Her feet like they never touched the ground
I like her red, but she light brown with the perfect smile
Same smile on our first child, whoa
Wait, wait Tune you need to slow down
Don't forget it's still the first round
I know, I know, but I just continue to do it
I just continue to do you
What is this voodoo?
Got me in this bitch like, ooh, ooh
Soundin' like I'm with the Zulu
I just continue to-, I just continue to do it
I just continue to do you
You got that ooh, ooh
Got me in this bitch like, ooh, ooh
Teach me some things, be my guru
You might also like
And this one goes out to the bald hair hoes, the long hair hoes
Hoes, hoes, ain't nothin' but hoes
The nappy hair hoes, the good hair hoes
Hoes, hoes
I'm doin' this for the curly hair hoes, straight hair hoes
Hoes, hoes, ain't nothin' but hoes
Those hoes ain't nothin' but hoes
Nothin' but hoes compared to the woman that I chose

Uh, a lot goin' down
'Cause I'm goin' down, finna move downtown
I won't stop until I hear the ooh, ah sound
Yeah, I won't stop until I-
I won't stop until I hear the ooh, ah sound

Lord, I don't know what I'm doin'
But you know just what I'm doin'
So with that said I'ma keep doin', keep doin' just what I'm doin'
My homies ask me how I'm doin', I can't wait to say I'm good
They say, "Be careful, she know what she doin'
But as long as you good then we good," that's my niggas
Nigga you hooked, you just don't know how happy you look
You a whole different person
You make it look worth it, you makin' me nervous and got these hoes shook
But fuck everyone, fuck the world, fuck everything
If she make you feel good, then you make her feel gooder
I feel like Nina, she Nina brown sugar
I'm high off of love, that's why she my pusher
And baby, tonight (Woo)
A lot goin' down (Yeah)
'Cause I'm goin' down, finna prove my crown (Yeah)
I won't stop until I hear the ooh (I won't stop), ah
And baby, tonight (Baby, tonight)
A lot goin' down (Yeah)
'Cause I'm goin' down, finna move downtown (Alright)
I won't stop until I hear the ooh, ah sound
Yeah, Lord, I don't know what I'm doin'
Lord, I don't know what I'm doin'
All she know is what I tell her, and all I tell her is I'm her's (I'm yours baby)
Lord, I don't know what I'm doin'
But I meant every word (Every word, baby)
Lord, I don't know what I'm feelin'
But it's a feelin' I deserve, yeah
Now all these hoes mad, all these hoes mad
We got all these hoes mad
They see how we makin' love, look so grand
A celebrity couple, they all know they fans of us both (Yeah)
I'm lovin' this shit, how hard do our kids feel confident, hell
Girl, I can't believe that he lovin' that bitch
They didn't even believe love still exist, but we showed 'em, yeah
Hoes, ain't nothin but hoes (Nothin' but hoes)
Nothin' but hoes compared to the beautiful woman I chose
