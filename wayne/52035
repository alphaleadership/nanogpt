21 ContributorsMoney Or Graveyard Lyrics
So give me money or give me the graveyard

Young Gudda money bags hot like hell bitch
I look like paper got a new money smell bitch
Pockets full of Luciana my plug Mexicana so I push keys like a brand new piano
Young money the safe like a bank volt my old school wet you should how much the paint cost
Its m.o.e nigga money over everything mutha fuck life shit this paper is what im cherishin
I'm so sincere like belly you haten I can tell it cuz you broke like the levey
I'm smoking like the Chevy exhaust pipe I horse pipe your girl an get back to the filthy
Got cheese like the deli a lot of mozzarella a soon to be legend thank Makaveli
And like Kanyeezy its nothing you can tell me nigga plus I never sleep there's not a dream you can sell me

So give me money or give me the graveyard

I'm the money man money money in the duffle bag
I don’t play the cards life deals so I shuffle them
Grind hard scuffle an fight for my spot with my muscle an bench press the shotgun I'm pumpin' it
We gonna get us or we gonna take there's with a nickle plated nina with a trigger cold hand
Play with that paper you’ll be in a wheel chair I knock them wheels off nigga you gonna need a spare
Yeah I'm goin off like the lights ain't paid cut your mutha fuckin lights out any day
Best believe me I need me got three c`s so I'm tryin sell a milli quick like C 3
Yeah I'm high definition TV you gonna need glasses better yet 3D Ha bet you mutha fucka`s see me its hard to get paper but I make it look easy

So give me money or give me the graveyard

Uh ohhh
Uh ohhhh
So give me money or give me the graveyard
Well look at the time, I am the alarm clock
Hurricane Wayne they like when will that storm stop
Boy I'm Optimus Prime, and shit on all you robots And what-not, I come around yo buhh-lock like bllllll-atttt
I rrrrock a nigga like Aerosmith, I'm arrogant Like fuck you, pay me, every cent
Its very simple, I don't know poor no more I keep a bunch of toys and ho ho ho
Ya know ya got money when a ho dont act funny
Bitch, I don't know you all I know is that money
Yeah I'm gettin' to the paper, im sippin' on that maple My chopper has no manners cause its sittin' on the table
Don't you know my nigga Gudda fuckin' kidnap kids
Fuck 'em in the ass, and throw 'em over the bridge
That's how it is, my shit is layed out And you get layed out, if I don't get paid out Ya dig2Embed
