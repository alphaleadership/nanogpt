1 ContributorBait LyricsLyrics from snippet

Look at them, look at them go
Look at them, look at them
Look at them, look at them go
Look at them, look at them
Yo, yo

Man don't do that talk, go Usain Bolt, got a box imported
Bro told me he just done that bait, two-two, know he got deported
One in his head, go two in his chest, feds come then it ain't important
Caught by the feds, go put it on tape, run it back, make voice distorted

I don't really know about darkside, tell Tunechi its wartime
