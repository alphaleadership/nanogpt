11 ContributorsUnderstatement Lyrics
Dear I fear, we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know it
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
"I tried" is an understatement
Just know I love you, you know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always...
Just know I love you, you know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
"I tried" is an understatement
But just know I love you, you know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always listening

You always crying, boo-hooing and sniffing
Think I'm always lying bout that one and this one
You always inquiring, fall back, mind your business
'Cause you see me with her don't mean that I'm with her
It was one night, I don't even remember
You think about the bitch more than I do
She don't think about you more than I do
Now you go get some new nigga
He can pretend to be all that you want
I won't befriend you
I'll just begin to continue the process of trying to forget you
Love is so mental
I bet you thought that shit wouldn't even get to a nigga like me though
But I am no robot
I take my key out your body, your door knob
And then watch some new nigga come knock that door down
The tables go 'round, go 'round
You know how this shit gon' go down
Since you Misses Know It All, I'm Mr. Know How
I know how to keep keep relationships low profile
But you want be seen, you want be envied
You don't want love, you want an image
'Cause I put real love right there in your face
You treat it like a blemish
Stop trying to be pretty, if you don't know anything baby
You might also like
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
"I tried" is an understatement
But just know I love you, you know I love you baby
If it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always listening

We always bickering, Lord knows I'm sick of it
I can't continue this, I just want happiness
You just want benefits
How can I benefit from this whole situation when I'm limitless
When it comes to my feelings and my willingness
To blame your ignorance on an experience
Still take you serious, I'm such an idiot
I'm fucking risking it fucking with you girl, fucking with you girl
Should've know you was just something to do when there's nothing to do girl
Now you talking this shit 'bout my new girl, acting like a lil girl
You are now no longer in Wayne's world, welcome to the real world
I'ma just move on, you should just move on
It ain't about who right or who wrong
It's about living the type of life you want
No need for us to go back, there's no moon walking in this bitch
I tried too hard to make this shit work but it's too gone
So let's just be friends and bury the hatchet and read what it say on the tombstone
It says...
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
"I tried" is an understatement
But just know I love you, you know I love you baby
If it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always...
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
"I tried" is an understatement
But just know I love you, you know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always...
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping...
And I'm always listening

Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know and
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
To make you do
Mama tells me...2Embed
