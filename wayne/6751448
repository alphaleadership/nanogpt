70 ContributorsTHANKFUL Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (We The Best Music)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Another one, DJ Khaled)

And I know that somebody been praying for me
Head above ground and I could've been six feet deep
Out on these streets, when I get down on my knees
I'm thankful (Thankful), I'm thankful (Thankful)
I'ma blow this bag for everybody who counted me out
And I still got love for all my dawgs who holding me down
Head above ground for my niggas and my dons
I'm thankful (Thankful), I'm thankful (Thankful)

I done dodged a few heartbreaks, yeah
Never lost a thing I can't replace yet
Couple times, thought I wouldn't make it (Thought I wouldn't make it)
Then I came up ten toes out thе basement
I done had to mutе, fuck noise
Did a couple things, they left me no choice
I done hit some licks that my mama won't be proud of
Said we gon' be rich, give her something she can smile for
The devil on the block and he lurking
Tryna hit me up with a dozen
But when I look around, shit ain't worth it
That's for certain, yeah
You might also like
And I know that somebody been praying for me
Head above ground and I could've been six feet deep
Out on these streets, when I get down on my knees
I'm thankful (Thankful), I'm thankful (Thankful)
I'ma blow this bag for everybody who counted me out
And I still got love for all my dawgs who holding me down
Head above ground for my niggas and my dons
I'm thankful (Thankful), I'm thankful (Thankful)

But I'm still out here making moves, ooh
I'ma do what I got to, I'ma do what I got to
Too many niggas gone too soon (I'm gonna do what I got to)
Ain't tryna lay up in a box two feet wide, six deep
You won't catch no RIP's off me
I'ma do what I got to (I'ma do what I got to)
I'm gonna do what I got to (I'ma do what I got to)
Somebody's been praying for me, for me
I could've been six feet deep
When I get down on my knees, I'm thankful, I'm thankful, I'm thankful

I'ma blow this bag for everybody who counted me out (Everybody who counted me out)
And I still got love for all my dawgs who holding me down (Holding me down)
Head above ground for my niggas and my dons
I'm thankful (I'm thankful), I'm thankful (I'm thankful), I'm thankful (I'm thankful)
Sit down, be thankful
Big smile although it's painful
I look up and see clouds, weed angels
Seen white chalk make street angels
You're welcome, look down, feet dangles
Be proud, be shameless
Yeah, be now, be ancient
Yeah, it been my turn, let me cut off these blinkers
I cut off these strangers and ifs ands and buts of the strangers
I never relinquish, I'm thanking Franklin as an acquaintance
Destiny danger, I done seen from every angle
From my neck to my ankle, the spots on this leopard ain't changing
Nigga, that's for the wankstas, 50 told me that, I say thank you
I been got the bag, I done turned that to the blanket
I been out of hand so I don't wanna dap 'less you banging
I'm being quiet, man, just waiting for these rappers to thank me, de nada

And I know that somebody been praying for me
Head above ground and I could've been six feet deep
Out on these streets, when I get down on my knees
I'm thankful (Thankful), I'm thankful (Thankful)
I'ma blow this bag for everybody who counted me out
And I still got love for all my dawgs who holding me down
Head above ground for my niggas and my dons
I'm thankful (Thankful), I'm thankful (Thankful)
But I'm still out here making moves, ooh
I'ma do what I got to, I'ma do what I got to
Too many niggas gone too soon (I'm gonna do what I got to)
Ain't tryna lay up in a box two feet wide, six deep
You won't catch no RIP's off me
I'ma do what I got to (I'ma do what I got to)
I'm gonna do what I got to (I'ma do what I got to)

Sit down, be thankful
Big smile although it's painful
I look up and see clouds, weed angels
Seen white chalk make street angels
You're welcome, look down, feet dangles
Be proud, be shameless
Yeah, be now, be ancient (Be ancient)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)3Embed
