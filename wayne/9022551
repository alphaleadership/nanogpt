1 ContributorWhiter Then Blow Lyrics
I want everybody over there
That 805, you know what it is 305
Right now, putting it down
Ah man, gotta give a big shoutout to DTF Radio
And the League Show, DJ 
I see you, can't forget 

From where the palm trees breeze
You might see something pretty on that beach
But don't get scared
You might see something the same color as me

I am on that 3-0-5 island, 8-4-5 riding
South Beach for you slow people that's trying to find where I am
Somewhere where the sky ends, celebrating signing
Pitbull said "Let's get this money", pretty boy keep smiling
Oh, I'ma get this corporatе fortune for sure
We don't need no kеy to success if we kicking down the door
Woah, hello (hello), hi (hi), Me and suits with my ties
Got a girl that raps up me up with a neck, I call her my tie
Funny funny, silly man, soccer moms in minivans
This a celebration, bitch, We pop champagne like Jimmy's Man
And I keep on going (going) til there ain't no body left
She asked if she could hold something
I said "of course", hold your breath
You might also like
They can't help it and I can't blame them
Since I got paid to spit and I'm whiter than blow
Getting it in, all these labels keep calling
'Cause they know I'ma win

And I'm whiter than blow
And I'm whiter than blow (Cash Money Millionaires)
And I'm whiter than blow

Bitches with the bitches, certified lickers
They get an appetite, they be call me each other's kitchens
No lie, I'm think I'm flier then I've ever been
No disrespect to Baby, but I think I gotta get it in
They say I'm hot, well is that so
I get more box in tic-tac-toe, Eeny-meeny-miny-moe
They rap me up like stripper poles
She could blow like the big bad wolf
Then I send her to the stove kinda like the pinky toe
Leave it numb, petty go

They can't help it and I can't blame them
Since I got paid to spit and I'm whiter than blow
Getting it in, all these labels keep calling
'Cause they know I'ma win
And I'm whiter than blow
And I'm whiter than blow (Cash Money Millionaires, yeah)
And I'm whiter than blow
