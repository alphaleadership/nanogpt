16 ContributorsForever (Remix) Lyrics
Remix, baby, fire
Chris, I got you
Okay, this your boy Chris Brown
And right now, y'all are listenin' to Tape Masters 8
Let's go

Ah-em
Before I get started, Polow, this beat is retarded
So I'ma go short, yellow bus flow and take her heart like February one-four
Y'all know I dos what I did, so gon' and does what you do
And you should come with the flu, 'cause, girl, you sick, shorty just sick
And she see Dr. Carter, I got the order
I make her tell her boyfriend not to bother
Haha, 'cause we get busy
We get silly, we get really
Drunk, and we do anything we want
And we go anywhere she like
But it's only for the night
Until forever, I'm so on another level
I'm so on another pedestal, my foot is on the pedal
I never ever swerve, baby, I'm on that syrup, baby
I know you fast, but I can make you err, baby
Don't hit the curve, baby, yes, I'm for sure, baby
I know you're hot, but I can make you hotter, baby
Like fur, baby, now we got PETA hatin'
But we put great to the test, and now we the greatest
And Weezy, he the greatest and this beat the greatest
And Polow, he the greatest
Rest in peace, Pimp C, the greatest
I'm gone
See Chris Brown LiveGet tickets as low as $58,500You might also like
It's you and me, moving at the speed of light into eternity, yeah
Tonight is the night to join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music
Around you, around you (Oh-oh)
I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there (Oh)
So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby
We can go anywhere, go anywhere (Yeah)
But first, it's your chance, take my hand, come with me

It's like I've waited my whole life (Oh) for this one night (One night, oh)
It's gon' be me, you and the dance floor (Dance floor)
'Cause we only got one night (Oh, oh, one night)
Double your pleasure, double your fun (Yeah)
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor

It's a long way down, we so high off the ground
Sending for an angel to bring me your heart
Girl, where did you come from? Got me so undone
Gaze in your eyes, got me saying, "What a beautiful lady"
No ifs, ands or maybes
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing
There's no one else that matters, you love me
And I won't let you fall, girl (Uh, fall, girl), let you fall, girl, oh (Uh)
You think, it's like infinity (Infinity, oh)
We're already at where we finna be (Finna be, oh)
Meanin' let's make our hopes our memories (Yeah)
Happily ever after endlessly (I won't let you fall)
You the president of Me and You Industries (Let you fall)
So it's drop Love Inc. on our enemies (Uh, let you fall)
Recycle all their negative energies (Uh, oh)
Then build Shake Em Haters Off ministries (Oh)
Trust, God willing, they could be like us (Us)
Out of our minds, in love, you know thus (Thus)
But, until then, let's keep it on the hush (Hush)
'Cause they comin' for our heads like brush cut
I interrupt the path I was goin'in down (Yeah)
On second thought, let's keep it on the loud (Loud)
If they don't know then, then they can know now (Now)
They don't know the way to do it, then we can show 'em how

It's likeâ€”
It's like I've waited my whole life (Oh, whole life) for this one night (One night, oh)
It's gon' be me, you and the dance floor (Me, you and the dance floor)
'Cause we only got one night (Oh, oh)
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Forever, ever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, everEmbed
