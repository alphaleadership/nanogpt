3 ContributorsI Donâ€™t Even Know You Anymore (Andy C Remix) Lyrics
Ah, yeah, uh
Hey

I don't know you; can't control you
Fight with the kid for no reason
Changing your mind like the season, ayy (Yeah)
I can't see you; don't believe you
Bad words at your mom when you angry
Convincin' me that you are crazy
I'm so tired of you draining my energy
Hold me up from here; keep that shit away from me

I don't even know you anymore, ayy
This feel different, something's missing
Every time you call, I hit ignore ('Nore)
I won't listen, save the bitchin'
Ooh-ooh, I don't even know you anymore
Ooh-ooh, I don't even know you anymore

This feel different, something's missing
I won't listen, save the bitchin'
Ooh-ooh, I don't even know you anymore
Ooh-ooh, I don't even know you anymore
See Netsky LiveGet tickets as low as $325You might also like
I don't fuck you like I used to
So you don't function like you used to
And sometime's I wonder, "How do you do?"
Say you love me, no, you used to
So tell the new you, she ain't nothin' but the usu'
The one I'm used to, I'm the one that showed you, you
You never knew you, colorblind to the true blue
But is it you? 'Cause I got blurry eyes off Gorilla Glue
It's really you? Are you tellin' lies? Well, it's feelin' true
Difficult 'cause right before the rise of the pinnacle
Got rid of you right before the lies became considerable
I wonder if that nigga knew that he was just a nigga too
I wonder if there's been a few, but anywho...

I don't even know you anymore, ayy
This feel different, something's missing
Every time you call, I hit ignore ('Nore)
I won't listen, save the bitchin'
Ooh-ooh, I don't even know you anymore
(I don't even know you anymore)
Ooo-ooo, I don't even know you anymore (Ah)

This feel different, something's missing
I won't listen, save the bitchin'
Ooh-ooh, I don't even know you anymore
(I don't even know you anymore)
Ooh-ooh, I don't even know you anymore
I don't even know you anymore
This feel different
Every time you call I hit ignore ('Nore)
I won't listen, save the bitchin'
I don't even know you anymore
Netsky, alright
I don't even know you anymore
Ooh-ooh, I don't even know you anymoreEmbed
