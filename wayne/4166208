5 ContributorsRoll Call Lyrics
I’m looking for a trap star
Slick talker, ghetto grammar
Dont matter red or blue bandana
Wheels too big how they fittin’ on your car
Back all tatted, couple war scars
Lookin’ for them boys whos up to most
 for sho’
And wear them Forces straight out the box
If that you-ou-ou, you know what to do-o-o
Look me up, hook me up with some of that
All of that

Stand up if this is you
I’m lookin’ for my boo
I’m ready now, I’m callin’ out for you
Answer to this roll call
Roll call, roll call

What I want, what I want
Stand up if this is you
I’m lookin’ for my boo
I’m callin’ you out, you better make a move

Hey, hey

Big ol’ titties, big ol’ butt

She like my grill, she like my chain

Got it on the block, everywhere am at
We in the streets, we at the mall
We outta town, I like to ball

Um, okay
They call me Young Carter and I’m big-dog
Thats right I’m off the chain, my leash ripped off
I gets straight to my goal like kick ball
And I’m so high if I come down there’d be a pitfall
Walk with a limp not like a pimp but like a big doll
And yes baby, i’m on fire like a menthol
My tires big from a far, look like the rims off
And I think CiCi need a nigga like Lil Weezy, um
Okay, I hear ya callin’ mama so it’s somethin’ good
We could get this fire started, nah baby, lets cut the wood
And I don’t paper chase, shorty I tug and pull
And I don’t eat to much of polk but I’m a fucking bull
Real talk, I like them red shorts
But I swear I love them tight pants
And when you do that lil’ dance on that mic stand
Stop playin’, I’m payed like a white man
And I think CiCi need a nigga like Lil weezy

I’m lookin’ for my boo
I’m ready now, I’m callin’ out for you

I’m callin’ all my down south,  boys
Can’t be faded boys
In the A, that’s where I’m from
So you know I’m giving ‘Nuff
I’m callin’ all, this ones for ya’ll
