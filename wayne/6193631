Tell that **** I'm a counselor, I could make it hold a convo
I could make that **** whisper, I could make that **** shout
Make that **** talk **** and tell that ****, "Wipe your mouth"
If that **** don't spit, then that **** cotton mouth
Make the **** talk business, sayin' words it can't pronounce
What that **** talkin' 'bout? I got that **** words slurred
I could make that **** talk and make it eat its own words, talk to me

Brought her back home and we did it on the tables like Lucci
Lookin' through my phone like, "Who she?" (Ah)
They think I'm country, but I'm a city boy (Boy)
When I'm in Detroit, link up with the-with the Boyz (Tron)
