21 ContributorsGreen and Yellow (Green Bay Packers Theme Song) Lyrics
Once a Packer, always a Packer
Like Shakur, call me two-pack
I'm green and yellow

Green Bay, Green Bay, huh? It gets scary, Halloween days
Scream face, huh? Bloody Mary, secondary
Jordan meme face, huh?
A-Rod got him offside, free play, huh?
That's a cheesecake, huh? On a hot plate, huh?
Hail Mary, yeah, Aaron to Davante
Green boogers, yellow as canaries
Eliantte, huh? Got me shinin' great, huh?
I just hit you boys with the Rodgers rate
Came up with the pack, I done well with the Pack'
Aaron Rodgers in the trap, I got 12 on my back
Got me rollin' out the pocket, Bakhtiari blockin'
Throw a pass to Tonyan, simple Madden science
Uh, pack him up, I know Prеston Smith gon' tackle him
I know Za'Darius Smith gon' back him up
And you know Darnell a savage, bro
Got Mason Crosby, thе kick is good
Green and yellow, we stickin' to it
Super Bowl goals, shootin' for the stars
Baby, trigger pull (Bow)

Okay, uh-huh, you know what it means
Cheesehead, Alicia Keys, I'm goin' Swiss cheese
Big G's, ballin' hard like Big Meech
Big league, Super Bowl champs, big rings
Big bling, Lombardi trophy, yeah, Vince team
Shinin' like a Bart Starr, number fifteen
In green, boy I'm fresher than some mint green
Listerine, 'bout to mess around, make history

Triple read, Green Bay chains, whistle clean
This a scene, like Paul Hornung, I got five on it
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh
I'm Green Bay, every day if you ain't know, then find out
Green and yellow, that forever, we on go nonstop
Freezin' weather, get the shovel, play in the snow, hot spot
Lambeau field for sure, Hall of Fame, number four
Legendary, just like Aaron, MVP, run up the score
Give the ball to Aaron Jones, let him run it down their throat
Touchdown, glasses on, Lambeau Leap in the front row
I'm screamin', "9-2" and that's for life
That's for Reverend Reggie White, rest in paradise
Coach Carter, boy, I'm feelin' like Matt tonight
I feel like number fifty-five, you gettin' sacked tonight
Yeah, boy, we 'bout to be in Tampa, hype
And whoever play the Packers, hope you packin' light
You flyin' back tonight, back to life
Yeah, uh-huh, all my Packers ready
Green and yellow, green and yellow
Green and yellow, green and yellow
Yeah, uh-huh, call me Pack-aveli
Green and yellow, green and yellow
Green and yellow, green and yellow
Yeah, uh-huh, we'll color that confetti
Green and yellow, green and yellow
Green and yellow, green and yellow
Yeah, we goin' all the way to Tampa, yellin'
Green and yellow, green and yellow
Green and yellow, green and yellow
Yeah, uh-huh, all my Packers ready
Ooh, you try to count us out, check your mathematics
Yeah, uh-huh, we'll color that confetti
Green and yellow, green and yellow
Call me Pack-aveli (Facts)

Uh-huh, you know what it means
I'm a cheesehead, Alicia Keys, I'm goin' Swiss cheese
Big G's, ballin' hard like Big Meech
Big league, Super Bowl champs, big rings
Big bling, Lombardi trophy, yeah, Vince team
Shinin' like a Bart Starr, number fifteen
In green, boy, I'm fresher than some mint green
Listerine, 'bout to mess around, make history
Pack-aveli
Once a Packer, always a Packer
Like Shakur, call me two-pack
I'm green and yellow, I'm green and yellow
I'm green and yellow, I'm green and yellow
I'm green and yellow4Embed
