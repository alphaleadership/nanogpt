2 ContributorsMy Life Lyrics
I'm grindin' until I'm tired
They say you ain't grindin' until you die
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day
A life of the night
Dear Lord, you took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
What the hell am I doin' right?
What the hell am I doin' right?

I'm grindin' until I'm tired
They say if you ain't grindin' until you die
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day
A life of the night
Dear Lord, you've took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
What the hell am I doing right?

Na na na na na
It goes around the world
Na na na na na
It goes around the world...You might also likeEmbed
