4 ContributorsNothing But Trouble (DJCJ Remix) Lyrics
I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now, I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models, I said they're nothing but trouble
They're nothing but trouble
These Instagram models, they're nothing but trouble

You got the world thinking you're a star
But you, you're not who you say you are
I'm dying, dying, dying, girl

I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now, I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models, I said they're nothing but trouble
They're nothing but trouble
These Instagram models, they're nothing but trouble

You got the world thinking you're a star
But you, you're not who you say you are
I'm dying, dying, dying, girlYou might also likeEmbed
