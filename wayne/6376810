23 ContributorsCall Me Nobody Lyrics
Ooh

Haters don't hate me, they hate their reflection
Threw all that shade in a different direction
Hate what you can't have, hate what you can't be
Mad 'cause you want more, hate 'cause you want mine, mad 'cause you ain't me
Winners, they focus on winning
Losers, they focus on winners
I never believed in ghosts 'til I saw my roof
But in the big city
No man gets pity that ain't did shit, they just get did shitty
While I'm alive, we gon' sit pretty
Oh, whеn I die, I don't know if I might ever see thе Holy Ghost
Don't know where I'm going, but I know that I ain't going broke
But I wanna see X and I wanna see Peep
So I pray to Juice WRLD every time I go to sleep, ah

And you can call me nobody if nobody is perfect
Call me a killer, I deserve it
I walk in with a ski mask like Jason
These bitches runnin', but it's money that we're chasing
You can call me nobody if nobody is perfect
Call me a killer, I deserve it
I walk in with a ski mask like Jason
These bitches runnin', but it's money that we're chasing
You might also like
I don't need none of your kryptonite
I'm just out here trying to get a life
'Sace pillows on my death bed, would you like to have a pillow fight?
It's never wrong 'til it isn't right
They say two wrongs doesn't make a right
So I make three lefts just to get back right
And if it ain't right, then I'm finna go nuts-dot-com
I feel as I've done my time
I've really done lost my mind
My shit done went bon voyage
The devil is three doors down
You really need love sometimes
I said, "Let's do lunch sometimes"
He said he can't trust my slimes
I ask them "How do I look in this Rolls Wraith?"
How do I look in this gold? Hey
Hang with demons 'cause I don't know no better
Every angel I know don't believe in Heaven
Tell the man in the mirror that know me better
Every time he see me, he scream, "Bloody murder"
Got a S on my chest, it's become a burden
And the voice in my head say, "You fuckin' heard me"
Am I brazy?

You can call me nobody if nobody is perfect
Call me a killer, I deserve it
I walk in with a ski mask like Jason
These bitches runnin', but it's money that we're chasing
You can call me nobody if nobody is perfect
Call me a killer, I deserve it
I walk in with a ski mask like Jason
These bitches runnin', but it's money that we're chasing
Forgive me
Yeah, yeah
You can call me
Forgive me
You can call me nobody if nobody is perfect (Forgive me)
I'm superman, woah, woah
They call me crazy
La-la, la-la, la
La-la, la-la, la
La-la, la-la, la
La-la, la-la, la2Embed
