Told him, dive in, this shit feel like water (Dive in)
Dive in, this shit feel like water (Dive in)
Dive in, this shit feel like water
Told him, dive in, this shit feel like water

"High tide, catch a wave if you wanna," she say (For real)
Underwater with no scuba, "You a goner," she say (Gone)
I'ma swim through that shit, show a fin in that bitch
I'm a shark in the ocean if she give me the bait
Drip, drip, wet, wet, wet all on the floor (Floor)
Busta Rhymes with the high, I told her, "Gimme some more" (Let's go)
Waterfall with the splash, bungee jump from a flight (Woo)
That shit was oh so right, I had to dive in twice (Two times)
Ain't no safety belt (Nah)
Ain't no jacket for the livin', ain't no safety here (Nah)
She was bustin' out the pipes from all the pressure in it
It'll never be the same if I ever hit it (Stretch)
Olympic gold, I'm a better swimmer
Yo, hittin' stroke at different angles
Damn, so much of the wet she had to change clothes
Woah, all of this water, what you drank for?
Damn, so much water I could sink though
You might also like
Told him, dive in, this shit feel like water (Dive in)
Dive in, this shit feel like water (Dive in)
Dive in, this shit feel like water
Told him, dive in, this shit feel like water

Yeah, divin' board, all aboard
Say it feel like water, I'ma be her waterboard
Better yet, her Aquaman, let me put my goggles on
I'ma go underwater, let me get my snorkel on
She said, "Sprinkle me, sprinkle me"
She said, "Finger me, finger me"
She said, "Tune, what you think of me?"
I said, "Let me think, let me think"
She asked me why is my drink so pink
I said, "Lean on me, lean on me"
Mix the codeine like Creatine
I'm her addiction and she a fiend
Liquid Lounge on my neck, drip crash, whiplash
She got that splish-splash, waterslide, Six Flags
Hose, pipe on site, hose, pipe on set
She got that wet-wet, and I'm a threat, threat, threat
Listenin' to Tity, we litty
K.R.I.T., he said he in the bitty
He with a bad-ass Brazilian
I'm with a baddie from Britain
She know some baddies that's 'bout it
They know some baddies that's with it
I'm 'bout to dive off the mountain
I'm 'bout to land in her river, she said...
Dive in, this shit feel like water (She said)
Dive in, this shit feel like water (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dive in, this shit feel like water (She said)
Told him, dive in, this shit feel like water (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Addiction (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Addiction (Wait, wait)
