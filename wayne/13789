Go 'head, lil' mama, I can transform ya
No, I can't dance but I could dance on ya
Swizz on the beat, Chris move ya feet (Transform you)
And baby, I can transform your "him" to a "me" (Transform you)
I can change your life, make it so new
Make you never wanna go back to the old you
CÃŽROC and lime, give it little time
And she gon' transform like Optimus Prime

Need a ride, I can Range you up
Money, I can change you up (Come on)
You can have your own, no longer be the passenger (Come on)
Swag low, I build you up
Knees weak, I stand you up (Woo!)
Red lips, red dress, like 'em like a fire truck (Chris)

What you need, you can have that (Woo!)
My Black Card, they don't decline that
See potential in ya, let me mold that
I can transform ya, I can transform ya (Oh, bounce, come on)

I can transform ya, I can transform ya
Anything ya want, I can, I can get it for ya
You're my baby girl so you know I did it for ya
I can trans, I can trans, I can transform ya
Shoes, you got it, got it
Bags, you got it, got it
Cars, you got it, got it
M-M-Money, you got it, got it
I can, I can transform ya, I can, I can transform ya
Anything you want I can, I can get it for ya (Come here, Chris)
See Chris Brown LiveGet tickets as low as $58,500You might also like
See it in the video, you can have it really though
Iced out everything, frigid like a eskimo
Wanna fly, we can go anywhere you wanna go
Jimmy Choos in Italy, Louis V in Tokyo
Something like Pinocchio, if you lie down, I'ma grow
Wanna see me do it big, I can show you how it goes
Take you from an amateur to being professional
I can have you swag surfin'

What you need, you can have that
My Black Card, they don't decline that
See potential in ya, let me mold that
I can transform ya, I can transform ya (Bounce)

I can transform ya, I can transform ya
Anything ya want, I can, I can get it for ya
You're my baby girl so you know I did it for ya
I can trans, I can trans, I can transform ya
Shoes, you got it, got it
Bags, you got it, got it
Cars, you got it, got it
M-M-Money, you got it, got it
I can, I can transform ya, I can, I can transform ya
Anything you want I can, I can get it for ya (Come on, Chris)
Okay, I can transform ya like a Transformer
I can turn you from a human to a Carter
Take you off the bench, t-turn you to a starter
Then I take you home and put you on a charger
Then-Then my car transforms to a charter
And we can fly to wherever you ever thought of
Haha, I take you to where it's warmer
Then I gotta rip off your dress like a warm up
Haha, but I'm just gettin' warmed up
So tell your man he better get his Voltron up
I transform her to a Ducati
Then I transform me to a Bugatti
'Cause her form puts me in a trance
I transform smaller and she puts me in her pants
Swizz-Swizz on the beat, Chris move ya feet
And Weezy transform a good girl to a freak (Bounce)

I can transform ya, I can transform ya
Anything ya want, I can, I can get it for ya
You're my baby girl so you know I did it for ya
I can trans, I can trans, I can transform ya
Shoes, you got it, got it
Bags, you got it, got it
Cars, you got it, got it
M-M-Money, you got it, got it
I can, I can transform ya, I can, I can transform ya
Anything you want I can, I can get it for ya (Come on, Chris)48Embed
