5 ContributorsI’m Good (Demo) Lyrics
Need I say I'm awesome  Boston
Goons we're taking everything but precaution
Your bitches wanna call us and text us like Austin
Pussy make me hard, pussy niggas make me nauseous
I've been on my feet since the day I started walking
Bitch, I think I'm MC Hammer, put the nail in the coffin
Sell coke in a drought, sell pussy at an auction
Chopper got a nigga running fast enough to race horses
Around here you sniff these lines, you don't cross 'em
Kill your ass and leave you behind like an orphan
I swear it happens all the time, very often
Still getting baseball money; Barry Larkin
Around here we play for keeps, yeah, we eating, but we starving
I get me a little money, try to spread it margarine
I'm flyer than a motherfucker, all my flights chartered
My diamonds white as  Carter, gone

Uhm, I don't have a conscience, all my friends are monsters
They visit me so constant and talk to me about nonsense
Like stabbing you and then watching you fight for your life like you boxing
Deuce deuce, I smoke that OG killer Bobby Johnson
I'll olly over that bitch head, it's Hollygrove til I'm fucking dead
This rap shit ain't nothing in me, I swear this shit's like cotton bread
But I still go hard with no regard, Earth ain't shit, bitch, go to Mars
Leave a nigga dead in the gutter
I'll just beat him with a bloody ass bowlingball
I'm fresh as hand sanitizer, don't hate the game, just analyze it
Two xanax', I'm fantasizing about fat bitches' panty sizes
Take a bullet to the chest, be a man about it
Stop acting like a little bitch nigga, most of y'all niggas is bitch niggas
I got a tiger in the basement, Big Tigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My money longer, my weed stronger
I feed hunger, I no longer get my weed from Fee
But we still tight like dyke pussy, that's my brother MOB
