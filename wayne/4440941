Uhm, damn they so noisy
I'm gone pray for 'em, goddamn I'm so holy

And lit up a fatty, ignore the chitchatty

Talk to my baby like "baby, what we got is real
But we got it secret, they think we won't make it

But you and I know what they don't know or heard (Oh lord)
How we feel when we together

How we feel when we together
Girl this could be heaven, forever my love
We ain't about money, but yeah we about love
Keeping our promise, keeping in touch
Keeping our faith, it's never too late
We were lovers but everything changed
