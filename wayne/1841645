3 ContributorsMotivation (Diplo Remix) Lyrics
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
(Yeah, check me out)
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Uh, girl, I turn that thing into a rainforest
Rain on my head, call that brainstorming
Yeah this is deep, oh, but I go deeper
Make, make you lose yourself, and finders keepers
It go green light, go, Weezy go
I like to taste that sugar, that sweet and low
But hold up wait, new position
I put her on my plate then I do the dishes
She my motivation, I’m her transportation
Cause I let her ride, while I drive her crazy
Then I just keep going going, like I’m racing
When I’m done she hold me like a conversation
Weezy, baby

And when we're done
(I wanna feel, I wanna feel, I wanna, I wanna feel, feel)
And when we're done
(I wanna feel, I wanna feel, I wanna feel my...)
And when we're done
(I wanna feel, I wanna feel, I wanna, I wanna feel, feel)
And when we're done
(I wanna feel, I wanna feel, I wanna feel my...legs)

Baby, I’mma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go
Baby, I’mma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go
Baby, I’mma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go
Baby, I’mma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go

Oh lover, don’t you dare slow down
Go longer, you can last more rounds
Push harder, you're almost there now
So go lover, make momma proud

And when we're done
(I wanna feel, I wanna feel, I wanna, I wanna feel, feel)
And when we're done
(I wanna feel, I wanna feel my...legs)
And when we're done
(I just wanna feel your, I just wanna feel your, I just wanna feel, feel)
And when we're done
(I just wanna feel your, I just wanna feel your...legs)
Baby (Ba-ba-ba-ba-baby)
So close
Baby (Ba-ba-ba-ba-baby)
So, so close
Baby (Ba-ba-ba-ba-baby)
So close
Baby (Ba-ba-ba-ba-baby)
So, so close

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, goEmbed
