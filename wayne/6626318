1 ContributorBest I Ever Had (Remix) Lyrics
(Teairra) This shit right here
(Marí) It gets me in the mood
(Ow) Baby, this for you
Shouts out to Drake, remix

We ain't gotta talk about it, babe, you should know your girl
Got your love, I give it to you better than them other girls
You can search the internet, pics of me, you'll never find
This is just forever, I swear you can be wherever
And I'll bring it to you nice till you get enough
And you ain't gotta spend a dime for us to live it up
You ain't gotta beg for it, it'll be right there
I say the same thing every single time

I say you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
The best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had

I ain't coming with them other chicks, bottles don't excite me
My life ain't no runway to model for the athletes
I don't play the groupie games, you can bet whatever on it
Baby, if you ever want it, dial them ten digits
And I'll bring it to you live till you get enough
If they hear them love birds chirping, then they know it's us
I got that good-good and when you ask for it
You say the same thing every single time
You might also like
He says that I'm the fuckin' best, I'm the fuckin' best
I'm the fuckin' best, I'm the fuckin' best
The best he ever had, best he ever had
Best he ever had, best he ever had, yeah

Sex, love, pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine, paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin' best (Aye), you the fuckin' best (Aye)
You the fuckin' best (Aye), you the fuckin' best (Aye)
You the best I ever had (Aye), best I ever had (Aye)
Best I ever had (Aye), best I ever had
I say you the fuckin' best (Aye), you the fuckin' best (Aye)
You the fuckin' best (Aye), you the fuckin' best (Aye)
You the best I ever had (Aye), best I ever had (Aye)
Best I ever had (Aye), best I ever had

Uh, awe yeah
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
Yeah, yeah
You know who you are
I got youEmbed
