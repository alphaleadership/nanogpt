Mama (English translation) Lyrics

Oh no Mama, oh, oh non Mama
I did my things go Mama
I will be there when you will feel hurt/ill
I will be there with or without money
I'm sorry I made you scream
I need to hold you in my arms
I'm scared that you will leave
My heart hurts Mama
I don't want you to leave me alone
I'm frantic, yeah Mama
There's my brother and there's me
And all the past behind me
I'm going forward for you
Because you're the only that will not leave me

Mama, you're my life, you're my blood
I would do anything for you Mama
There are ups and downs
When you're not feeling well, you, my heart beats
Mama
You're my life, you're my blood
I would do anything for you Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama

The only one who wouldn't mind me
The only one who I wouldn't doubt
The only one who didn't let go of me
And that since my first steps
Mama if I could
I would give you a house on the Moon
But I learned in this world of bastard
That what makes a man is not money
For you I would give my life
And you know it's the same for my brother
I'm sick of all these problems
I can't say "I love you" anymore, my heart is jammed

Mama, you're my life, you're my blood
I would do anything for you Mama
There are ups and downs
When you're not feeling well, for you, my heart beats
Mama
You're my life, you're my blood
I would do anything for you Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama

Mama, you're my life, you're my blood
I would do anything for you Mama
There are ups and downs
When you're not feeling well, for you, my heart beats
Mama
You're my life, you're my blood
I would do anything for you Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama

Mama, you're my life, you're my blood
I would do anything for you Mama
There are ups and downs
When you're not feeling well, for you, my heart beats
Mama
Mama, you're my life, you're my blood
I would do anything for you Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
You're my life, you're my blood
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Eh yo Mama, eh yo Mama
Mama Mama
